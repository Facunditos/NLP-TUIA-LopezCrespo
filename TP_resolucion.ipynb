Designed to commemorate the efforts and sacrifices of the men & women of the Second World War, we trust it will provide youwith a sense of history and the desire to learn more about that Greatest Generation of all. Our fondest hope is that you will also transmit that unique historical heritage onto younger generations. Days of Wonder, Inc. – May 2004 FROM THE AUTHOR Memoir \\'44 is a unique historical game that allows players to effectively portray stylized WWII battles. The battles, showcased in the scenario section, focus on important terrain features and the historical deploymentof forces in scale with the game system. By design, Memoir \\'44 is not overly complex. Its main focus is on theground forces of the Axis and Allied armies. The scale of the game fluctuates from battle to battle. For some scenarios, an infantry unit may represent an entire battalion, while in other scenarios a unit may represent a single company or platoon. But the tactics youneed to execute conform remarkably well to the advantages and limitations inherent to the various units, theirweapons and terrain. The game mechanics, although simple, will still require strategic card play, timely dice rolling and an aggressive, yet flexible battle plan to achieve victory. Welcome and Enjoy! Richard Borg33From the opening minutes of D-Day to the liberation of Paris and beyond - Memoir \\'44 airdrops you into the key battles that turnedthe tide in Western Europe.

Components A recent intelligence sortie behind enemy lines recovered an unusual cardboard box. As per protocol, the contents were examined, itemized and entered into the logbook: ✪A double-sided Battlefield board map (beach landings and countryside) ✪2 Punchboards featuring: — 44 double-sided Terrain hex pieces — 10 double-sided Victory Medals — 14 Special Forces badges— 4 double-sided rectangular Bunker and Bridge tiles ✪2 Army bags of miniatures (Green Army: Allied Forces; Blue-Gray: Axis/German Forces), each containing: — 42 Infantry figures — 24 Armored vehicles — 6 Artillery pieces — 18 man-made Obstacles — 3 Cardholder sections ✪1 Deck of 70 cards, including: — 60 Command cards • 40 Section cards • 20 Tactic cards — 9 Summary cards • 7 Terrain cards • 1 double-sided Unit summary card • 1 double-sided Obstacle summary card ✪8 Battle dice ✪1 Rules and Scenario booklet ✪1 Days of Wonder Online access number located on the back of the Rules and Scenario booklet German US Rangers British AirborneFrench FFI Medal of HonorDouble sided Hex Iron Cross Bridges Bunkers Command cardsInfantry Artillery Armored vehicles GERMAN FORCES ALLIED FORCESBarbed wireHedgehogs Sand bags Section cards Tactic cards Terrain cards Units summary Obstacles summary Terrain summary Grenade Star Armor Infantry (x 2) Flag44Setting up the game You will greatly benefit by applying a small degree of discipline (Buck Up Soldier!) when setting up a game scenario in Memoir \\'44. We strongly recommend that you follow the step-by-step approach outlined below when setting up a game, especially for your first few plays. The reward is an endless variety of battlefields to play on, and theopportunity to pick-up fascinating historical tidbits and information from each of the scenarios played. 1 - Select a battle from the scenario section of this booklet. If this is your first game of Memoir ’44, we strongly suggest you start with the first battle - Pegasus Bridge, p 19. This battle was both the openingengagement of D-Day and is a good introductory scenario to Memoir ’44. 2 - Place the board in the center of the table, with the proper face (countryside or beach landing) visible. For Pegasus Bridge, this means the countryside face up. 3 - Place the necessary Terrain hexes, as indicated by the battle scenario. For Pegasus Bridge, lay the 20 River hexes, then 4 Village hexes and finally 9 Forest hexes. 4 - Add the fixed (Bunkers and Bridges) and removable Obstacles, if any. For Pegasus Bridge, this means two bridges, one over each river, and four barbed wires and asandbag placement to protect the bridge’s perimeter. 5 - Now place the figures on the board, matching the various units’ positions to the scenario’s battle map.Experience shows that dropping one figure per hex, for posi-tioning purposes, then filling up the units as required, is thequickest way to set up. An Artillery unit is usually made of 2 figures, an Armor unit - 3 and an Infantry unit - 4. 6 - Add the Special Unit badges to individual units and Victory Medals to specific, on-the-map objectives, ifrequired per the scenario’s special rules. For Pegasus Bridge, place an Allied victory medal on each bridge. 7 - Place the Terrain summary cards that correspond to the terrain in the scenario (Wood, Towns & Villages and Rivers summary cards for Pegasus Bridge) , plus the Obstacle and Units summary cards, to the board’s side, for in-game reference. If needed, refer to Terrain in Appendix 2 (p 13)for additional details on each terrain’s effects. 8 - Assemble the cardholder segments and place them on the board map’s edges. The card holders are not necessary, but are particularly useful when playing in teamsof multiple players to a side, or in a classroom/demonstration environment. With them, players on a same side can point to and study various options. 9 - Now choose each player’s side and sit in front of the board accordingly. Given the relatively short duration of a typical battle scenario, we recommend match play, with each player taking first one side, then the other in an immediate re-match.This helps balance any historical advantage that one side may have in a particular scenario. The winner of the match is theplayer who scores the most Victory Medals after both battles. 1 6+ 34Place Terrain hex. x20 x4 x912 10 8 75510 - Shuffle the Command cards deck thoroughly, and deal Command cards to each side per the selected scenario’s briefing notes. Place those cards in your respective cardholder, keeping them secret from the opposing player. For Pegasus Bridge, the Allied Commander-in-Chief receives 6 Command cards, while the German General starts with a meager 2! Rommelshouldn’t have been vacationing on that fateful day! 11 - Place the remainder of the deck face down, alongside the board’s battlefield, within easy reach of both players. 12 - Each side takes four Battle dice. 13 - The starting player (in Pegasus Bridge — British Major, John Howard) , as indicated in the scenario’s briefing notes, begins play. Battlefield Battles are fought over a hexagonalgame board 13 hexes wide by 9hexes deep. The battlefield isdivided into three sections by twored dotted lines, giving each playera left flank, a center and a rightflank section. Where a dotted linecuts through a hex, the hex is con-sidered to be a part of both theflank and center section. Command Cards Army units may only move and/or battle when given anorder. Command cards are used to order your troops tomove, battle and/or execute a special command. There aretwo types of command cards: Section cards and Tactic cards . Section cards Section cards are used to order a move and/or battle in a specific section. These cards indicate in which sec- tion(s) of the battlefield you may order units and how many units you may order. Tactic cards Tactic cards allow you to make special moves, battle in a specific way or take special actions, as explained on the card. Some cards allow you to order troops in just one section, while others order units in all sections.2 546 Place UnitsCommand card deck x4 x1 x24 x3611 12 10 Section cards Tactics cards COUNTRY SIDE BEACH SIDE66Object of the Game The object of the game is to be the first to win a set number of Victory Medals (usually 4 to 6, depending on the selected battle scenario’s victory conditions). In Memoir ’44, a Victory Medal is gained for each enemy unit entirely eliminated from the battlefield. Each Medal won is designated by placing the last figure of the eliminated unit on any of the available Medal Stands located on your bottom leftedge of the board. In some scenarios, additional Medals may be gained from the board map itself, for capturing and holding certain terrain hexes or battlefield objectives. Game Turn The player listed in the briefing notes goes first. Players then alternate taking turns, until one of the players reaches thenumber of Victory Medals indicated in the scenario’s victory conditions. 1 - Play a Command Card At the start of your turn, play one Command card from your hand. Place it face up in front of you, and read it aloud. Command cards are normally used to order units to move and/or battle. The card you play will indicate in which section(s) of the battlefield you may issue orders, and how manyunits you may order. 2 - Order Units After playing a command card, announce which corresponding unit(s) you chooseto order. Only those units that are issued an order may move, battle, or take a special action, later in the turn. Units on a hex with a red dotted line running through it may be ordered from either section.On your turn, follow the sequence below: 1 - Play a Command card. 2 - ORDER . Announce all units you intend to order, within the limits of the Section or Tactical Command card just played. 3 - MOVE . Move all ordered units you wish, one at a time. Respect unit and terrain movement limitations, as per the summary cards. 4 - BATTLE . Battle one ordered unit at a time. Select an enemy target and a.Check Battle Range (by counting down the Battle dice, see page 9), and Line of Sight (page 9) b.Check for potential Terrain effects (page 13). c.Resolve Battle (page 10) 5 - Draw a new Command card. Or77You may not give more than one order to each unit. If the Command card allows you to issue more orders in a given section of the battlefield than you have units in that section, those additional orders are lost. 3 - Move Units Movements are announced and made sequentially, one ordered unit at a time, in the sequence of your choice. A unit mayonly move once per turn. A unit that is ordered does nothave to move. You must complete one unit’s movement before beginning another. In addition, you must complete all unit movements before proceeding to Battle (step 4). Ordered units may move from one section of the battlefield into another. Two units may not occupy the same hex. When moving a unit, you may not move onto or through a hex occupied by a friendly or enemy unit. You may not split off individual figures from a unit; they must stay together and always move as a group. Units that are reduced through casualties may not combine with other units. Some terrain features affect movement and may prevent a unit from moving its full distance or battle (see Terrain section on page 13). Retreat movement rules vary slightly from regular movement (see section on Retreat page 10). • Infantry Movement An ordered Infantry unit may move up to 1 hex and battle or2 hexes and not battle. Starting PositionExample: To move the infantry unit to its destination to the village\\'s right, you must first move the unit ahead of it out of t he way. This is forbidden First, move the right unit, 1 hex to the right……then move the other unit. The armor unit must move 3 hexes, around the infantry, to reach its destination Move 1 and battle Move 2 and no battle Splitting is forbiddenRegrouping is forbidden or88Special Forces Infantry units ordered may move up to 2 hexes and still battle! • Armor Movement An ordered Armor unit may move up to 3 hexes and battle. • Artillery Movement An ordered Artillery unit may move 1 hex or battle. 4 - Battle Battles are checked and resolved sequentially, one ordered unit at a time, in the sequence of your choice. You must announce and resolve one unit’s battle entirely before beginning the next one. A unit may only battle once per turn. A unit that is ordered does not have to battle. A unit may not split its Battle dice between several enemy targets.The number of casualties a unit has suffered does not affect the number of Battle dice it will roll in combat. A unit with a single figure left retains the same firepower as a unit at full strength. A unit attacking an adjacent enemy unit is said to be in \"Close Assault\" with that enemy. A unit attacking an enemy unit more than 1 hex away is said to \"Fire\" at that enemy. A unit adjacent to an enemy unit must Close Assault this unit if it chooses to battle. It may not fire on another, more distant, enemy unit instead. Special Forces move 2 and battle! Armor units move up to 3 and battle Artillery guns either move… …or battle. or CLOSE ASSAULT: attack an adjacent hex FIRE: attack from a distance Combat Procedure To battle: 1 - Announce the ordered unit you want to attack with, and its target. a.Check Battle Range: verify that your target is within battle range or contact; b.Check Line of Sight (Infantry and Armor only): verify that your target is within line of sight. 2 - Count down the number of Battle dice to roll, based on the type of unit you’re attacking with and its distance to target. 3 - Determine terrain Battle dice reduction, if any. Reduce the number of Battle dice rolled accordingly. 4 - Resolve Battle: Roll Battle dice and resolve resulting dice rolls.99• Battle Range - Infantry An ordered Infantry unit may battle any enemy target unit 3 or fewer hexes away. It rolls 3 dice in close assault (enemy on adjacent hex), 2 dice against a target at 2hexes, and 1 die against a target at 3 hexes. To determine the number of Battle dice to roll, simply “count down” the number of dice rolled: Position your finger on the firsthex adjacent to your unit and move it, one hex at a time, in thedirection of the target, counting down (“3”, “2”, “1”) as youreach new hexes. The last number you pronounce when your fin-ger reaches the target is the number of dice you should roll. • Battle Range - Armor An ordered Armor unit may battle any enemy target unit 3 or fewer hexes away. It always combats at 3 dice. • Battle Range - Artillery An ordered Artillery unit may battle any enemy targetunit 6 or fewer hexes away. It combats at 3,3,2,2,1,1 asillustrated on the right. • Line of Sight To battle, an Infantry or Armor unit must be able to \"see\" the enemy unit it wants to target. This is known as having \"line of sight\". An Artillery unit doesnot require line of sight to target an enemy unit. Imagine a line drawn from the center of the hex containing the battling unit to the center of the hex containing the enemy target. The line of sight is consid-ered blocked if any hex (or part of a hex) intercepting this imaginary line seg-ment contains an obstruction. Obstructions include units (friends or foes) orcertain type of terrain features. The terrain in the target hex does not block line of sight. When the imaginary line runs along the edge of one or several hexes which containobstructions, the line of sight is notblocked, unless the obstructions standsomewhere along both sides of the linesegment. Enemy at 2 hexes Allies unit has line of sight Line of sight is blocked on both sides Line of sight is blocked on both sides Enemy out of range Range and number of dice rolled by infantry, based on distance to target. Infantry is said to \"combat at 3, 2, 1\" Range and number of dice rolled by armor Range and number of dice rolled by artillery Line of sight from the left unit to the enemy is blocked by the center unit The Allies unit has line of sight to the unit in the woods\\' border, but not to the other unit hiding behind the woods.1010• Terrain Reductions Each type of terrain and obstacle is described in the Terrain and Obstacles section (Appendix 2, p 13). Please refer to that section or the corresponding summary cards, and deduct any potential terrain Battle dice reduction from the number of diceto be rolled in the attack. • Resolve Battle Hits are resolved first, followed by retreats. Hit In battle, the attacker scores 1 hit for each dice symbol rolled thatmatches the unit type targeted. Each Grenade rolled is also 1 hit. For each hit scored, 1 figure is removed from the target unit. When the last piece in the opponent\\'s unit is removed, place it on top of one ofthe empty Medal Stands on your side of the battlefield. If an attacking player rolls more hits than the number of figures in the defending unit, these additional hits have no effect. Miss Retreat The player controlling the unit decides which hex his unit retreats onto using the following rules: ◆A unit must always retreat toward its controlling player’s side of the board. ◆Terrain has no effect on retreat moves, therefore a retreating unit may move through a forest or village without stopping. However, impassable terrain may not be moved through during a retreat move. ◆A unit may not retreat onto, or through, a hex already containing another unit (regardless if friend or foe). ◆If a unit cannot retreat; is forced to retreat off the limits of the battlefield; or would be pushed back onto a sea hex, one figure must be removed from the unit for each retreat move that cannot be completed. ◆Some obstacles will allow certain units to ignore the first flag rolled against them. Score 1 hit on Infantry Score 1 hit on Armor Score 1 hit on any type: Infantry, Armor or Artillery HIT MISSIf the attacker fails to roll any of the symbols needed to hit the enemy target or to force the enemy to retreat, this is a miss. The Star side of the Battle die is used in a limited number of Tactical Command Cards, otherwise it is a miss. RetreatAfter all hits have been resolved and casualties removed, retreats are resolved. For each Flag rolled on the target unit, the unit must move one hex back toward its own side of the battlefield. Two flags push the unit back two hexes, etc. Allied unit rolls a Flag, an Infantry and a Star. After taking 1 casualty, the Axis unit has 2 possible retreats: or1111• Taking Ground When an ordered Infantry unit in Close Assault combat eliminates the enemy unit or forces it to retreat, it mayTake Ground by advancing into the vacated hex. An Artillery unit may not take ground. Terrain movement and battle restrictions still apply when units take ground. When an ordered Armor unit in Close Assault combat eliminates the enemy unit or forces it to retreat, it may take the ground by advancing into the vacatedhex and claim an Armor Overrun combat. • Armor Overrun Combat On a successful Close Assault Combat, an ordered Armor unit may move into the vacated hex and may then battle again. If the ground you take during theOverrun puts you adjacent to an enemy unit, this second battle must onceagain be a Close Assault Combat. Otherwise, you may fire at a distant unit. ◆A unit may Take Ground again after a successful Overrun Combat. ◆However, an Armor unit may only make one Overrun Combat during a turn. ◆All Battles, Close Assault and Overrun Combats must be completed before the next unit may battle. 5 - Draw a Command card After resolving all hits and retreats, discard the Command card played and draw another card from the deck. Your turn is now ov er. If the draw deck runs out of cards, the discards are shuffled to form a new draw deck. Here, another Axis unit is in the way - there is only one retreat path left: Allied Infantry rolls a Flag and an Infantry symbol on a Close Assault The Allied player chooses to \"Take Ground\" immediately, to take advantage of the forest’s cover.After taking one casualty, the Axis unit retreats Allied Armor rolls a Flag and an Infantry symbol on a Close Assault The Allied player chooses to \"Overrun\" immediately After moving in, the Armor unit can now battle again!After taking one casualty, the Axis unit retreats An Axis unit and a river block both retreat options – the Axis unit cannot move and takes one additional casualty as a result : 1 2 3 41212Appendix 1 - SPECIAL UNITS Using the Special Units summary card On the back of the Standard Units summary card is a list of the various types of Special Forces and other Elite units that may be encountered in Memoir ’44. Rounded corners at the top of a unit’s symbol are used to denote a Special Forces or Elite unit on the map. A number in the lower right corner of a unit’s symbol is used to indicate the number of figures per unit, when it differs from the standard number. Special Forces and Elite units behave in the same way as the corresponding (Infantry or Armor) standard unit in all respects except as described below and on the summary card. Using the Special Forces Badges In scenarios combining Standard and Special Units relying on the same figures (Commandos mixed withInfantry on the edges of Sword Beach, for example), use the corresponding Special Forces badges, putting one into each hex occupied by the Special Unit, to distinguish it from regular troops. French Resistance benefited from a superior knowledge of the countryside and increasing support of the population as the war went on. As such, French Resistance forces: ◆May always battle when they penetrate a new terrain type (Woods, Villages, Hedgerows) where standard Infantry would stop and not battle. ◆May disappear in the countryside, retreating up to 3 hexes instead of the standard 1 on any retreat flag rolled. ◆Their limited number means they always start with 3 figures per unit, in lieu of the standard 4. ◆Unlike other Special Forces, French Resistance units that opt to move 2 hexes may not battle on the same turn. Special Forces (including US Rangers, British Commandos and other Elite units): Special Forces Special Forces and Elite units symbols and powers Axis \"Kommandos\" British special troops Rangers unit \"LA RÉSISTANCE\" is the generic term used to describe the various movements (armed or not) that fought the Axis forces in occupied France following the surrender of 1940. General De Gaulle\\'s widelyheard broadcast of June 18th, 1940 on BBC galvanized patriots of all political and geographic origins.Increasingly larger, well organized and better equipped groups sprang into action over the followingyears, providing an effective \"Shadow\" army in the days leading to D-Day. In close contact with the Allies, who often air-dropped them arms and money, the Resistants sabotaged supply lines, sheltered Specialforces operating behind the enemy lines, and assassinated prominent figures of the German-backed regime.From 1944 on, the military groups within the Resistance became known as the FFI (“Forces Francaises del’Intérieur” – French Forces of the Interior). The intelligence they offered during the preparatory stages ofOperation Overlord paved the way for the successful Allied landings. The Rangers shoulder patch of the units who attackedthe Pointe-du-Hoc The \"Pegasus\" shoulder patch of the British 6thAirborne Division whotook \"Pegasus Bridge\" Axis attacked Resistants who were hiding in the woods, and rolled 2 flags. Resistants choose to retreat and take cover in the village that is as far as 4 hexes away The patch of the German \"Grossdeutschland\" elite forces1313Special Forces historically acquired superior mobility and firepower thanks to their ruthlesstraining and non-standard armament: - Unlike regular Infantry, Special Forces may move 2 hexes and still battle (instead of being forced tochoose between moving 1 hex and battling, ormoving 2 hexes and not battling). They remainsubject to usual terrain limitations however. Elite Armor Elite Armor units, such as the German divisions outfitted with Tiger tanks, were a devastating enemy on thebattlefield. - Unlike regular Armor units, Elite Armor units start with 4 tank figures per unit, denoting their exceptional resistance to all but a well-aimed shot from the back. Appendix 2 - TERRAIN Using the Terrain Help Cards The Terrain Help cards provide a short summary of the key effects of each terrain type.When you set up your scenario, display the Help Cards that correspond to the terraintypes used in the scenario on the side of the board. — The Effect section describes the various features of the terrain.— The soldier and the tank icons indicate the defensive capabilities of the terrain. In this example, attacking infantry units roll 1 less die, and attacking armor units roll 2 less dice. Forests ◆Movement: A unit that enters a Forest hex must stop and may move no further on that turn. ◆Battle: A unit may not battle the turn it moves onto a Forest hex. ◆When battling an enemy unit that is on a Forest hex, Infantry reduce the number of Battle dice rolled by 1, Armor reduce the number of Battle dice rolled by 2 and Artillery Battle dice are notreduced.◆Line of Sight: A Forest blocks line of sight. Effect section defensive capabilities of the terrain …but they are still subject to terrain constraints: here, they stop and do not battle because of the woods hex. Elite Armor have 4 tank figures Special Forces move 2 and battle! Turn #1: Allied player moves into the woods: the unit must stop and cannot battle this turn Turn #2: Axis player moves closer and battles, but rolling 2 dice instead of 3, because the Allied Infantry is protected by the woods. Turn #3: Time for revenge! The Allied player can now battle, with 3 dice.1414Hedgerows Hedgerows are a landscape typical of Normandy: small grass fields separated by tall rows of shrubs, tree lines or fences. This proved to be very difficult terrain for the Allies as they wouldnever know what danger lay hidden behind the next hedgerow. ◆Movement: To move onto a Hedgerow hex, a unit must be adjacent to the Hedgerow. A unit that enters a Hedgerow muststop and may move no further on that turn. A unit that leaves a Hedgerow hex may only move onto an adjacent hex. ◆Battle: A unit may not battle the turn it moves onto a Hedgerow hex. ◆When battling an enemy unit that is on a Hedgerow hex, Infantry reduce the number of Battle dice rolled by 1, Armor reduce the number of Battle dice rolled by 2 andartillery Battle dice are not reduced.◆Line of Sight: A Hedgerow blocks line of sight. Hills ◆Movement: No movement restrictions.◆Battle: When battling an enemy unit that is up a Hill, Infantry andArmor reduce the number of Battledice rolled by 1 and Artillery Battledice are not reduced. When battling an enemy unit at the same height as your unit, there is no Battle dice reduction.◆Line of Sight: A Hill blocks line of sight for units trying to look over the Hill. Line of sight is not blocked when units are at the same height and on the same Hill (plateau effect). Towns & Villages ◆Movement: A unit that enters a Town hex must stop and may move no further on that turn.◆Battle: A unit may not battle the turn it moves onto a Town hex. ◆When battling an enemy unit that is on a Town hex, infantry reduce the number of Battle dice rolled by 1, Armor reduce thenumber of Battle dice rolled by 2 and Artillery Battle dice are not reduced. Armor on a Town hex will reduce the number of Battle dice it rolls by 2.◆Line of Sight: A Town blocks line of sight. Turn #1: move and stop next to the Hedgerow hexTurn #2: you may now enter the Hedgerow hex Turn #1: move and stop next to the Hedgerow hexTurn #2: you may now move normally Allies attack from a lower elevation, rolling 2 dice instead of 3 But if they are on a hill too, they roll 3 dice Allies can battle because they are on the same height Other town and village hexes:1515Rivers & Waterways ◆Movement: A River is impassable terrain. A unit may only enter a River hex when the hex has a bridge.◆Battle: A unit on a River hex with a bridge battles as normal.◆Line of Sight: A River does not block line of sight. Oceans ◆Movement: A unit that moves onto an Ocean hex may move a maximum of 1 hex. Units are assumed to be onlanding craft or in shallow waters until they move ontoa Beach hex. An Ocean hex is impassable terrain forretreat moves.◆Battle: A unit on an Ocean hex may not battle. ◆Line of Sight: An Ocean does not block line of sight. Beaches ◆Movement: A unit that moves onto a Beach hex may only move 2 hexes.◆Battle: No combat restrictions. A unit may still Take Ground after a successful Close Assault Combat.◆Line of Sight: A Beach does not block line of sight. Amphibious \"DD\" Sherman tank unit moves only one hex while in water On the next turn, it drops its flotation device, and moves 2 hexes onto the sand Axis Infantry rolled an Infantry and a Flag symbol The Allies unit cannot retreat, and so takes 2 casualties instead of 1 The Armor unit must take the bridge to cross the River The Infantry unit can fire over the RiverFIXED OBSTACLES When an obstacle is on a Terrain hex, the Battle dice reductions of the two are not cumulative. The best protection is the only one that matters. For example, a bunker on a hill reduces the number of dice rolled by a tank attacking from a lower elevationby 2, not 2+1 (bunker protection is 2, hill is 1). Another example: a sandbag on a village does not add anything to the villag e protection (village defense is 2/1, sandbag defense is 1), though it does provide an additional feature: any unit in the villag e may ignore the first flag rolled against it, due to the sandbags. Bunkers ◆Movement: An Infantry unit may battle the turn it moves onto a Bunker hex. An Armor or Artillery unit may not move onto a Bunker hex. Artillery units that start on a Bunker hex may not move from the hex. ◆Battle: Only the side noted in the briefing notes may claim a Bunker as a defensive position. ◆When battling an enemy unit that is on a Bunker hex, Infantry reduce the number of Battle dice rolled by 1, Armor reduce the number of Battle dice rolled by 2 and Artillery Battle dice are not reduced. ◆Remove one Artillery figure for each retreat Flag rolled against an artillery unit in a bunker. ◆ A unit in a bunker may ignore the first flag rolled against it. ◆Line of Sight: A Bunker blocks line of sight. Hedgehogs Hedgehogs were obstacles against tanks and landing craft. They were usually made of steel rails assembled together. They could also be made of wood, with an anti-tank mine at theirtop. Unexpectedly, the Allied infantry troops used them for cover while moving on beaches. ◆Movement: Only Infantry units may enter a Hedgehog hex. No movement restrictions. ◆Battle: No combat restrictions. A unit on a Hedgehog hex may ignore the first Flag rolled against it. ◆Line of Sight: A Hedgehog does not block line of sight. REMOVABLE OBSTACLES Sandbags ◆Movement: No movement restrictions. When a unit leaves a hex with Sandbags, the Sandbags are removed. ◆Battle: A unit in a hex with Sandbags is protected on all sides, not just along the hex-sides where the Sandbags are placed. When a unit does not benefit from any protection for its terrain, the sand-bags reduce the number of Battle dice rolled by 1 when attacked by Infantry or Armor. As usual, Artillery Battle dice are not reduced. ◆ A unit hidden behind sandbags may ignore the first flag rolled against it. ◆Line of Sight: A Sandbagged hex does not block line of sight. Wire ◆Movement: A unit that enters a hex with Wire must stop and may move no further on that turn. ◆Battle: An Infantry unit that is on a hex with Wire, will reduce the number of Battle dice it rolls by 1. An Infantry unit that is eligible to battle may remove the Wire instead of battling. Armor must removethe Wire and may still battle.◆Line of Sight: Wire does not block line of sight. 1616Appendix 3 - MULTI-PLAYER GAMES, VARIANTS & ADDITIONAL SCENARIOS Team Play The simplest way to play with up to six players is to try Memoir ’44 in team play! Make two teams of up to 3 players a side (if you have an odd number of players, simply put one more player on one side than on the other). Each team places their Command cards on a card holder, pointing out and evaluating possible strategies internally before jointly agreeing on the card to play. The member of the team most directly concerned by the card being played then carries outthe relevant actions, moving units, selecting targets and rolling Battle dice where appropriate. ◆In 2-player teams, one player is in charge of the center of the battlefield and acts as Commander-in-Chief, while the second player directs the two flanks. ◆In 3-player teams, each player is assigned its own individual section. The player in the Center is also Commander-in-Chief. The Commander-in-Chief is responsible for playing Tactic cards that apply to no particular (or all) sections of the battlefield . Memoir ‘44 Overlord – battles on a grand scale! Experienced players will want to combine multiple copies of Memoir \\'44 to play scenarios over large, multi-board battlefields in a new kind of meta-game, known as Memoir ’44 Overlord! Overlord scenarios are unique in that two (and in some instances three!) boards are combined into one single, oversized battlefield, allowing up to eight players (four to a side) to replay his - torical WWII battles on a grand scale. With Memoir \\'44 Overlord , players can experience the frustrations associated with being part of a military style WWII chain of command and at the same time, enjoy the challenges of coordination and cooperation needed to gain the victory. The bat-tle scenarios and maps are stylized, but thanks to the larger scale, they focus with additional detail on major and minor ter-rain features that existed on the original battlefield, and fine tune the historical deployment of the Axis and Allied forces. A special bonus scenario is provided on the last page of the battle section of this booklet called Omaha Beach - Overlord Version . This bonus scenario requires the supplemental \"Memoir ’44 Overlord – rules booklet\" which can be downloaded free from our web site at: www.memoir44.com Variant for Young Generals If needed, young children can play a simplified version of the game and still have a lot of fun with it. Young children often count better than they read, so we suggest the following modifications: ◆Remove all Tactic cards from the deck – just keep the Section cards ◆If needed, you can choose not to play the Take Ground and the Armor Overrun rules ◆Every time the deck is exhausted, remember to shuffle the Section cards before making a new deck It is easier if an adult introduces the children to the game, and plays a couple of games with them. It is also a good opportun ity for a parent or a teacher to use the game as an introduction to the Allied involvement during WWII and draw their interest intothe battles that shaped our modern history. Additional Scenarios Memoir ’44 is a game of endless possibilities. The various offensives and counter-attacks, critical battles and lesser-knownskirmishes, plus the numerous other theaters of operations on which WWII was fought provide a fertile ground. In collaboration with Memoir \\'44 author, Richard Borg, Days of Wonder will continue to update the game through the regular release of new campaigns and scenarios, additional rules, materials and miniatures, etc… For a first taste of things to come and additional hours of enjoyment visit us and make sure to register at: www.memoir44.com 1717'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":14}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Referencia principiantes (documento PDF)"],"metadata":{"id":"jKvemY0ZdYpr"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["referencia_principiantes_path = drive_path+\"datos/Memoir_44_beginner's_reference.pdf\"\n","referencia_principiantes_crudo = extract_text_with_pypdf2(referencia_principiantes_path)\n","referencia_principiantes = limpiar_texto(referencia_principiantes_crudo)"],"metadata":{"id":"9YYDpeEodbp1","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1739498373702,"user_tz":180,"elapsed":1220,"user":{"displayName":"Facundo López Crespo","userId":"17242818259053124562"}}},"execution_count":15,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["referencia_principiantes"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":200},"id":"mUrTN_-3d9jU","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1739498375271,"user_tz":180,"elapsed":468,"user":{"displayName":"Facundo López Crespo","userId":"17242818259053124562"}},"outputId":"1c32cee0-8834-426b-e0af-b9005962daa6"},"execution_count":16,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'Days of Wonder, the Days of Wonder logo, Memoir ’44, the Memoir ’44 logotype and all related product and brand names are registered trademarks or trademarks of Days of Wonder, Inc. and copyrights © 2002 -2007 Days of Wonder, Inc. MEMOIR ’44 – A BEGINNER’S REFEREN CE INTRO This guide is targeted to Memoir ’44 beginners and is meant to help them better interpret some of the rules of the game. It is NOT meant to replace any of the following MUST READ documents : - the rulebook : (http://static.memoir44.com/lang/english/images/mm_rules_part1_en.pdf ) - the official FAQs: (http://www.days ofwonder.com/memoir44/en/content/faq/ ) - the unofficial FAQ available at BGG: (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/file/download/35704/M44_Unofficial_FAQ_v12.pdf ) The unoff icial FAQ is 90% similar to the official one, but better structured and easier to search for information. This document will not help more experienced players and also does not discuss (at least for now) any of the expansions, since the main target is the new player, having only the base game and needing a jumpstart or some reference. DOCUMENT REVISION S Version 0.1 released for comments. It c ontains only 11 TACTIC CARDS explained. Version 0.2 released for comments. It contains all 15 Tactic cards from th e base game and a scenario setup. Version 0.3 released for comments. It contains all 15 Tactic cards as well as a 5 turn game explained step by step. TACTIC CARDS Most of the “special” (or Tactic) cards from Memoir are pretty clear, but there are some whic h are a little bit harder to grasp, and I realised that beginners tend to get these wrong sometimes (I hope I got them right:) . Also, the FAQs are great in discussing some important cases and how they should be treated so I will not go over the same topics unless I feel they are pretty important and are worth duplicating here. All cards that specify a number of units to be ordered also allow you to order “0” units which means you just pass the turn, discard the card and draw another one. This number is NOT mandatory; it represents just the maximum number of units that can be ordered.Page | 2 1. ARMOR ASSAULT When played, this card allows the player to issue an order to 0 -4 ARMOR units he has on the board, no matter the section. Ordering the units is the same as with a normal command card (first pick all the units to order, then move them all if needed or possible , then battle if needed or possible). The card adds a bonus to those 4 ARMOR units: if they will battle in Close Assault, they will roll 1 additional die ( e.g. we have an armor unit 3 hexes away from an infantry unit; it can battle without moving with the normal 3 dice, or move 2 hexes near the targeted infantry unit and roll an additional die becaus e now it is in Close Assault and it can benefit from the bonus ). Terrain movement and battle restrictions still apply ( e.g. if attacking an infantry in a town from 2 or 3 hexes away, roll 3 -2=1 die per the normal rules; if attacking an infantry in a town in Close Assault, roll 3 -2+1=2 dice, using the bonus ). If the player has NO Armor units on the board, it can order 1 other unit of his choice (e.g. infantry or artillery). The additional die will also be used if making an Armor Overrun in a Close Assault position.Page | 3 2. COUNTER -ATTACK This card practically duplicates any card that your opponent just played. If he played for example Pincer Move (“order 2 units on the Left and 2 units on the Right sections ”) you can use Counter -Attack just like if you had in hand a Pincer Move command card. Counter -Attack when played always borrows the effects of the last card played by the enemy. The sections will be preserved (if your enemy plays “Attack” with 3 units on his left , when counter -attacking you will also play “Attack” with 3 units BUT in the same section, which is on your right ). Apart from this section change, the effects are duplicated entirely. A player can also play Counter -Attack to a Counter -Attack card (e.g.: player A plays “Probe” with 2 units on his left, you play Counter -Attack which will let you order 2 units on your right – the same section as your opponent – and now if he wants to order 2 units on the same section but does not have any “normal” command card for this, he can play a Counter -Attack w hich will borrow the effects of your Counter -Attack – which also borrowed the effects from the original Probe card – and he will be able to order 2 units on that very disputed section :) You cannot play this card during your opponent’s turn like the Ambush card.Page | 4 3. DIRECT FROM HQ This card is self explanatory: choose 0 to 4 units of ANY TYPE and order them per the normal rules (examples: you can order 2 infantry + 1 armor unit + 1 artillery OR 2 armor units OR any combination of maximum 4 units of any type)Page | 5 4. INFANTRY ASSAULT The player can order ALL infantry units (no matter how many) but in only 1 section. The se units benefit from the card’s bonus: they are able to move up to 2 hexes and still battle (in contrast with the normal action of moving only 1 hex and still battle) OR move 3 hexes but not battle (in contrast with the normal action of moving 2 hexes and not battle). This rule simply adds a hex for the movement of normal units. For Elite units, the difference is smaller: they can ALREADY mov e 2 hexes and battle without this card, so the card will only improve their abilities if they want to move 3 hexes and of course not battle, which they normally would not be able to do. Terrain movement and battle restrictions still apply ( e.g. if entering a forest after a 1 hex move, a normal infantry unit must still stop and cannot battle – per the forest restrictions - even if this card would allow it to continue the move and/or attack ). Like many Tactic cards, this one also allows you to order 1 unit of any type you have available, in case you have NO infantry unit s on the board.Page | 6 5. MOVE OUT! Choose 0 -4 infantry units from anywhere on the board and issue them orders. There is no special bonus and the terrain movement and battle restrictions still app ly. If there is no infantry unit available anywhere on the board, order 1 unit of any other type.Page | 7 6. AMBUSH This card is a special one: it is the only one that can be played DURING the opponent’s turn. That’ s right: if your opponent orders a unit ( e.g. moves an infantry unit of his near one of your armor units ), and then he declares Close Assault on one of your units, you can play this card in this very moment , before he gets to roll the dice. Immediately after playing it , he loses the chance to att ack and you get to roll dice first (according to your attacked unit rules, just like if you had attacked his unit first). There are 3 possibilities depending on the result of your attack: - You do not eliminate his unit nor make it retreat : in this case afte r your attack, he gets to attack you back. This happens even if you eliminate PART of his unit, but not all and also his unit maintained position. - You roll some flags and the enemy has to retreat : in this case he loses the chance to attack you and the turn is over for his unit (he will continue with other ordered unit or end turn) - You eliminate the enemy unit : of course the enemy has no unit now to attack you with and the Ambush was succesful! The opponent can continue his turn until completion with the re st of his ordered units. After playing this card, you should replentish your stock of cards by drawing another card (before your opponent does, at the end of his turn). You can “ambush” only one attack per card played (e.g. if on the opponent’s turn he mov es 3 units and it is clear that he will declare close assault on all 3 cases being near some of your units, you cannot play an ambush card for all your units, but only one, at your choice ; the Ambush card will still be played immediately after the enemy declares a close attack on the unit you chose to protect but before he gets to roll the dice). You cannot play Ambush and order another unit of yours: the ordered unit MUST be the one that the enemy intended to attack in close assault.Page | 8 7. ARTILLERY BOMBARD This card allows you to order ALL your artillery units (you are not forced to order them all if you don’t want/need to). These artillery units that are ordered with this card may EITHER move up to 3 hexes (normal movement restrictions apply ) OR battle tw ice ( e.g. you can attack twice the same target or carry out 2 attacks on different targets ). If you have NO artillery unit on board, issue an order to any unit you have available.Page | 9 8. BARRAGE Many beginners misinterpret this card. It actually gives a pla yer a “bonus attack”. The attacking unit is “outside” the board, there is no unit on the board that will actually attack , there is only the attacked enemy unit on the board . Once this card is played, the player chooses ANY enemy unit (it can be a normal i nfantry unit or an elite one, an armor unit, an artillery unit and so on). He does not have to have line of sight or be in the attacking distance (remember, there is no attacking unit on board, how could we calculate line of sight or distance then ?) . The player doesn’t even need to have an artillery unit, he can play this card even if he has only 1 soldier left and the targeted unit is on the other side of the board :). Once an enemy unit is targeted, the player rolls 4 dice, IGNORING any terrain reducti on (e.g. even if the targeted unit is an artillery unit in a bunker on a hill, the player still rolls 4 dice). The player scores 1 hit for each unit symbol or grenade (as in the normal rules) but unlike the normal rules, the flags cannot be ignored !! (the unit HAS TO retreat even if it would normally be protected from flags by bunkers, sandbags and so on). Of course, if for example we have an artillery unit in a bunker (as you know, this special combination does not allow the artillery to retreat) and the player rolls 2 flags, the flags will not be ignored and the unit will be lost (for every flag that must be executed on an artillery unit in a bunker, an artillery figure will be lost, since it is not allowed to retreat).Page | 10 9. BEHIND ENEMY LINES First of a ll the card is wrong (I understand it has been revised and reprinted). The correct description: “[…] Terrain movement and battle restrictions still apply […]” This card allows you to send a unit in the middle of the enemy’s territory (“behind enemy lines”), attack and then come back. The player chooses 1 infantry unit (no matter the section) and this unit will be allowed to: - Move up to 3 hexes (0 -3 hexes) ignoring terrain movement restrictions ( e.g. it can pass through 3 towns without stopping just as if there was no hex in its way )! - Attack an enemy unit (using 1 additional die as a bonus but applying any present battle reductions ) - Move again up to 3 hexes (0 -3 hexes) ignoring terrain movement restrictions. Some notes: - Any of the 3 actions above can be skipped (they are not mandatory; e.g. you can only attack without moving, or attack and then move, or just move 6 hexes (3+3 with no attack), etc .). - The unit cannot pass unpassable terrain (rivers are still blocking movement for all troops). - There is no requirement to move towards enemy territory; for example you can use this card to order an infantry unit with only 1 soldier figure to “return home” from enemy territory by ordering it to move 6 hexes towards your side (it can also attack somebody on i ts way back, after the first 3 hexes). - A unit cannot move 2 hex es, attack, and then move 4 hex es for a total of 6. A 6 hex move can be obtained only with a 3+3 hex move (or, in special cases, if the attack carried out between moves is followed by a “Take Ground” action, one additional hex is gained).Page | 11 10. CLOSE ASSAULT This card is best played when many of the player’s units (infantry or armor, not artille ry) are adjacent to enemy units because this card lets you order ALL these units . There is no movement allowed before or after playing this card (Taking Ground and Armor Overrun are permitted). Ordered units get to roll 1 additional die (the rule applies only to initial attack of a unit, not also in the Armor Overrun phase). There i s no limit on how many troops you can order: as long as an infantry or armor unit is already adjacent with an enemy unit at the start of the turn and does not need to move to become adjacent, it can attack with that additional die. The units that are not a djacent to enemy units will be ignored this turn.Page | 12 11. DIG -IN This card has many issues already clarif ied in the FAQ so I will not repeat them here. Basically the card allows a player to choose 4 infantry units from all over the board and improve their pro tection by placing sandbags on the units’ hexes. The units are not allowed to move and/or attack during this turn, they just work hard to protect themselves by building the sandbags. If the player has no infantry unit available, he may issue a normal orde r to 1 other unit of his choice (move/battle).Page | 13 12. FIREFIGHT When a player plays this card, he can choose 0 -4 of his units (no matter the type) and order them. These units: - Cannot be adjacent to ANY enemy unit - May not move during this turn (they can only fire/battle if there are enemy units in range) Each of these 4 units will roll 1 additional die when attacking. Terrain and battle restrictions still apply (first the number of dice to be rolled is calculated, per the normal rules then 1 die is added to th e result ). Of course, if an enemy infantry is 4 hexes away from our infantry unit – out of range - we cannot attack it, thinking that “we normally have 0 dice to roll and we add 1 which means we will attack with 1 die”. The attacked enemy unit MUST be in r ange first of all.Page | 14 13. MEDICS AND MECHANICS This card gives the player a chance to recover some or all of the figures of an incomplete unit (a unit that suffered casualties). First the player chooses one of his units to be recovered or repaired (any type is accepted). Then he rolls 1 die for each command card he has in hand including this card ( e.g. the current scenario specifies that the player has 6 cards, so he will roll 6 dice). The rest is explained pretty well on the card: for each unit symbol 1 lost figure of that unit is returned to duty. Star also counts in this case as a “recovery point”. A unit MAY NOT gain more figures than it originally had ( e.g. infantry will only have a maximum of 2 figures, normal armor units 3 figures, etc ). The good part: if after rolling this dice the player recovers at least 1 figure for that unit, the unit can also be issued an order (like any normal order: move and/or attack). Grenades and flags are ignored. An artillery figure can be repaired (re covered) only by roll ing a star (there is no “artillery” sign on the dice). Example play : we have in the heart of the enemy territory a poor infantry unit that suffered many casualties, it is down to 1 soldier figure and is a sure medal for the enemy. We can choose to help thi s unit by playing this card. After playing it, we specify to the other player the unit we will recover (our infantry unit) and if the current scenario specifies we should have 4 cards in hand, we will roll 4 dice. Let’s say the 4 dice are: 1 x Infantry, 2 x Armor, 1 x Star. The 2 armor dice do not help us (since we are recovering an infantry unit) but the Infantry die and the Star die allow us to bring 2 soldiers back in the unit which boosts our unit to 3 figures (Stars are like jokers in this case). Since we were able to recover at least 1 figure, we can now normall y order this unit (e.g. move out of the danger zone and then maybe attack an enemy unit). If in this case the dice roll is for example 4 Armor units, we cannot recover any figure and the turn ends here (no more orders). If we roll 2 flags and 2 grenades, it is the same outcome (turn ends). If we get 4 stars, we will only be able to recover 3 figures up to the unit’s maximum number which is 4. The remaining star will be ignored.Page | 15 14. THEIR FINEST HOUR This special card allows the player to order a random nu mber of his units, depending on his luck. When playing the card, he first takes a number of dice equal to the number of cards he has in hand in the current scenario , and rolls them. These dice will only specify how many units and of what type the player is able to order this turn. As in the “Medics and Mechanics” card, we can roll infantry (and then order infantry units), armor (and then order armor units) or star (and roll any unit we want , infantry, armor or artillery ). Flags and grenades are ignored. Example play: As soon as we play this card, we roll 5 dice (supposing our current scenario specified we should have 5 cards in hand). Some examples: - 2 x Infantry, 2 x Armor, 1 x Star: we will be able to order 2 Infantry units, 2 Armor units and one unit of o ur choice (including artillery). - 3 x flags, 2 x Stars: we will be able to order 2 units of any kind - 3 x infantry, 1 x Armor, 1 Grenade: in this case let’s say we have no infantry unit on the map, so we will only be able to order an armor unit, if available. As you see, an artillery unit can be ordered only if stars are rolled (there is no “artillery” sign on the dice). After we choose the units based on the outcome of the dice, they are ordered as per the normal rules, with a bonus: +1 die for each attack, added after applying normal battle and terrain reductions. A rule that is often ignored: after this card is played, all face down and discarded cards are reshuffled (maybe to give the other player also the chance to get this card).Page | 16 15. AIR POWER This is a powerful card when enemy’s units are grouped (adjacent to each other ). When playing this card, the player chooses a group of maximum 4 enemy units that are adjacent to each o ther and orders an “air” attack on them. Just like the “Barrage” card, t here actually is no unit on the board that attacks the enemy, it is considered to be a “bonus” attack from other off -board units (a virtual “air support”). Once the 4 grouped units are specified, the player attacks them one by one (w ith 2 dice if he is Al lied, with 1 die if he is Axis). Terrain reductions or battle reductions are all IGNORED. The attacked unit gets one hit on normal symbols rolled (infantry, armor or grenade which means any unit) but ALSO if stars are rolled. Flags cannot be ignored so the attacked units must retreat (or lose figures if it is unable to do so ). Example play: we are playing as Allies and we notice that in a far corner the enemy has 3 units placed in a straight line, adjacent to eachother. It does not matter how they are placed as long as they are adjacent. Examples: or (our example) We choose where to start (from left to right for example) and begin a surprise air attack on these units: we first roll 2 dice (we are Allies, remember; Axis only roll 1 die) for the leftmost infantry unit, then 2 dice for the middle one then 2 dice for the rightmost one. The order is chosen by the attac ker. Our sample rolls: - For the leftmost infantry unit: 1 x Flag, 1 x Armor. Unit loses 1 figure (armor is ignored, flag cannot be ignored even if there are terrain protections on that hex; the unit has nowhere to run from its edge hex). - For the middle infantry unit: 1 x Grenade, 1 x Star. Unit loses 2 figures. - For the artillery unit: 1 x Grenade, 1 x Star. The attack is powerful, the unit is down to 0 figures and we get a medal!Page | 17 GAME BASICS: A MEMOIR ’44 SAMPLE SESSION The last part of this document aims to give newcomers a good idea of how a Memoir ’44 session looks like. I will not discuss each and every move, but I will point out some of the important moments of a fight, some basics of ordering troops or interpreting die reductions as well as try to intro duce some of the tactic cards we already talked about. During the explanations we will not generally discuss good strategy , it’s up to the player to play, learn and discover this. Many of the moves will seem pointless, they will be chosen because I think t hey are important to show you HOW they should be played so, again, do not rely on correctness of gameplay strategy- wise. Reading and understanding the rulebook is vital and cannot be replaced with this document. Screenshots were made using the Vassal engin e - http://www.vassalengine.org/ . I will base our explanations on the Toulon scenario (Campaign for Southern France) – August 20 -26 1944 (http://www.daysofwonder.com/memoir44/en/editor/view/?id=23 ). Axis player gets 4 cards, Allied player 6 cards. The battle ends when the first player get s his 6th medal. Also, we have a “sudden death” condition: if at any time Allied units occupy 3 town hexes in Toulon at the end of their turn, they win immediately.Page | 18 1. UNITS IN THIS SCENAR IO Normal Infatry uni t. 4 soldier figures. Normal Armor unit. 3 tank figures. Only Allied player in this scenario . Elite infantry unit (may move 2 hexes and still battle, unlike normal units where the player has to choose between moving 1 hex and battle or move 2 hex and not battle). Only Allied player has this in this scenario . An “American Elite Infantry” badge is placed in each of the el ite units to differentiate them. Artillery unit. 2 artillery figures. Only Axis player in this scenario . 2. TERRAIN (IMAGES FROM THE NEW “AIR PACK” TERRAIN C ARDS)Page | 19 3. GENERAL VIEW The Axis side is well fortified with sandbags protecting them, units place d on hils or in towns, making attacks against Axis difficult or risky . Moreover, on the right side, forests will slow down Allied troops. The Axis artillery unit is protected by the town hex and the barbed wire that will decrease the efficiency of Allied infa ntry attacks (armor attacks might be a solution here , trying to go around the barbed wire or using tanks to remove the barbed wire). In the center section, 2 well protected Axis i nfantry units make it hard to move forward this way. 4. GENERAL NOTES Note 1: some sandbags are placed on hill hexes, some on town hexes. Still, t he reductions are never cummulative. Example: we attack an infantry unit in a town with sandbags, with an armor unit outside of the town. Towns provide a defense against armor units of -2 dice. Sandbags only provide -1 protection. These numbers are not added, but the highest one is used. In t his case, we will roll - 2 when attacking with the tanks. There’s a question here: why do we need the sandbags since even without them we would still be protected by the town hex with - 2 against armor? The answer is that although sandbags do not influence t he number of rolled dice, their protection against flags is retained (“ occupant may ignore 1 flag”). Towns do not normally offer protection to flags (retreats) but a sandbag on a town will allow the attacked unit to choose if it ignores or executes the fir st flag (if more flags are rolled, the other flags have to be carried out, only one can be ignored). <- new battle dice reduction symbols original symbols - > Note 2: the vast majority of terrains only specify how they PROTECT the units placed on them against other “external” infantry or armor attacks (artillery not included since it always ignores terrain protection). The unit on the hex never matters in these calcula tions: for example, in a FOREST it does not matter if we have an infantry unit, an armor unit or an artillery unit; the forest will protect a ny unit with -1 against infantry attack or - 2 against armor attack. Still, there are some terrain types which also specify reductions when ATTACKING from those hexes. For example, it is supposed that a tank does not have good maneuvrability or attacking power in a town so, as specified in the “Towns and Vi llages” terrain card, if attacking with an armor unit FROM a tow n hex, you have to roll - 2 dice. Only a small part of the terrain types limit the firepower of the units placed there (notably armor in towns battles out at -2 dice and infantry on barbed wire battles out at - 1 die) and there is no special symbol for this, just text on the terrain cards . Note 3: t he wording of the terrain cards or the rules is very important. If you “may” do something it means you are NOT FORCED to do it, but you may choose to do it. If you “must” do something it means you are FORCED to do that. For example, when protected by sandbags you MAY choose to ignore first flag rolled against you so you ARE NOT FORCED to retreat (you may or may not retreat). When entering a forest, a unit MUST stop, so there is no way that you can move further if y ou enter a forest hex (unless you’re retreating, in which case you are ignoring terrain hexes, but that’s another story). Note 4: w henever a Recon card is played (which allows the player to order only 1 unit in one section) at the end of the turn the player gets to draw 2 cards, choose one to keep in hand and discard the other. This advantage balances the low attack power of the Recon cards.Page | 20 5. BATTLE SESSION MOVE 1 – ALLIED PLAYER Allied pla yer plays a Probe card (2 units on the left to be ordered). We choose to move an infantry unit closer to the artillery unit. Since this is an Elite unit it can move 2 hexes and battle (a normal unit would only be able to move 1 hex and battle or move 2 hexes losing the right to battle). We also bring in some tanks , just to have artillery in range. If we bring them too close, the artillery will also have a better chance of hitting them. In this position, the artillery will only use 2 dice. If we get close r with the tanks, artillery will be able to roll 3 dice agains t the tanks (remember that artillery uses 3,3, 2,2,1,1 dice and we are now 3 hexes away, so 2 dice). Also, if we bring the tanks closer, near the Axis infantry, they will not be able to attack the artillery, because they are adjacent to another enemy unit: “a unit adjacent to an enemy unit must Close Assault t his unit if it chooses to battle; i t may not fire on another, more distant, enemy unit instead”. After we show the other player the units we will be ordering (infantry and armor) we get to the moving ph ase, so we move the 4 soldiers + badge and the 3 tanks as show n below. We can never split /combine units and we can never attack until we finished moving all units (i.e. we normally never move a unit once the battle phase started, unless we play a special c ard like “Behind enemy lines” or we “ Take Ground ” or make an “Armor Overrun”). Once units are moved, we attack our main target there: the artillery unit. In the battle phase that follows, we choose who is attacking what and in what order , one unit at a ti me (you ARE NOT forced to specify all the attacks in detail at the beginning of this phase; sometimes this rule helps you a lot, because you may want to attack one unit with more units of yours, but after the first attack, you roll some flags and the enemy retreats outside the attacking range of the other units; in this case, you can always attack other units in range ). Let’s say we start with the Infantry unit. We should first check that we have line of sight (we do, barbed wire does not block LoS) and the n calculate the number of dice to be rolled. We are 2 hexes away from the artillery, which means 2 dice (infantry attacks 3, 2 , 1 depending on the distance). Unfortunately, artillery is protected by the town (-1 die for infantry attacks) and the sandbags ( -1 die for infantry attacks). As pointed out before, the battle reductions are not cumulative, so we will get a total reductio n of - 1, as well as protection for 1 flag rolled, thanks to this special feature of the sandbags. Total number of dice: 2 – 1 = 1 die. We roll a FLAG. That’s not too good, because the enemy can now choose to ignore this flag (it is not forced to, he may as well retreat outside of town). The enemy does not retreat, since this means it would lose town protection, and our attack was not succesful. Same phases occur with tanks too. They have line of sight so we can go on calculating the number of dice. Tanks normally roll 3 dice, up to 3 hexes away (3, 3, 3 ). Towns have an even better protection agains tanks ( -2 dice) which is higher than sandbags protection ( -1) so -2 will be used . We roll 3 – 2 = 1 die : a GRENADE. At last we’re getting somewhere. An artillery unit is removed from the board and our turn ends. We draw a new card.Page | 21 MOVE 2 - AXIS PLAYER Axis Player play s now the “Direct from HQ” card which lets him order ANY 4 units he want s (any 0 -4 units actually, with 0 meaning “pass”). Axis show s the other player the units he will be ordering (an infantry in the forest and the artillery on the left side (since Axis is on the opposite side, we talk about their right side, but we will always refer to our left and right as we watch the map). Axis wil l also move 2 infantry units on the right side of the map. 4 units total. The next phase is the movement phase (I prefer to combine naming the ordered units with movement because it does not really influence anything, and I only get through the units once not twice). Axis will move the infantry out of the forest (which is not such a great idea, but we do it now to block the armor’s Line of Sight to the artillery as well as increase firepower for the infantry, now in Close Assault). The artillery is not mov ed so it is skipped. Axis also moves the 2 infantry units on the right. The one near the town of Toulon is moved 2 hexes so it cannot attack any more (there is no enemy unit in range anyway) and the other one moves to a hill, only 1 hex, so that it is stil l able to attack the Allied units. Once all movements take place, the Axis player starts attacking, in the order of his choosing. He starts with the artillery on the left. This unit can attack many possible units (it has a big attack range) but it wants t o focus on the tanks. Artillery units do not care about terraing reductions or line of sight, they just fire :). In this case, tanks are 3 hexes away which means 2 dice. The dice are rolled and we get INFANTRY and GRENADE. Infantry is ignored since we are attacking tanks, but the grenade does the trick and we have one less tank figure (unit goes down to 2 figures). Artillery ends its turn.Page | 22 The board after the movement phase: Axis goes now to the infantry unit, which is in Close Assault, without any terrai n reduction and of course with good Line of Sight which gets us a 3 dice roll. Axis gets ARMOR, STAR, GRENADE. Yupee ! STAR is ignored (it has no power unless used with special tactic cards), ARMOR eliminates a tank figure and GRENADE does the same. The tank unit is removed from the battlefield. One of the eliminated tank figures goes to a medal placeholder on the Axis side, which means they have now only 5 medals to go. Back to our last infantry unit: since the attack was a Close Assault and the attacked unit was eliminated (or forced to retreat) the unit can Take Ground now and move to the hex previously occupied by the tanks. Its turn is over (we should mention here that the tank units can also Take Ground, but they can also attack AGAIN after taking ground, which is called Armor Overrun – more details in the rulebook page 11). No unit is forced to take ground if it does not want to. On the right side of the board, one of the infantry units moved 2 hexes so no battle this turn (nobody to attack anyway) but the other unit, now placed at a safe height, chooses to attack one infantry unit below (second row from the bottom, second unit from the right). It rolls 2 dice (no terrain reductions, and the range is 2 hexes): FLAG and INFANTRY. Infantry means one fig ure is removed, but what about the flag? The flag means that the attacked unit MUST retreat (if not protected by something like a sandbag or a bunker). Unfortunately for this unit, it has nowhere to retreat, since both options to go back are occupied by ow n colleagues. In this case, a unit loses a number of figures equal to the number of flags that cannot be played – retreat is blocked – in our case 1 figure. The turn ends for the Axis player, he draws a new card.Page | 23 The board after the battle phase, at t he end of the turn : MOVE 3 – ALLIED PLAYER As the Allied player, since we liked the card that Axis played last turn, we will play “Couter -attack” which gives us the possibility to “copy” our opponent’s last card. So actually, by playing this card, we will play “Direct from HQ”. We will order the 4 red-dotted units on the screenshot below. O n the left, we moved an infantry unit so that the tanks will be able to get out of the corner and another infatry unit on the barbed wire near the artillery. It wou ld be nice to be able to go over the barbed wire to a clear hex and get rid of the “ infantry attacks with - 1 from wire hex ” rule, but unfortunately there’s another wire hex rule: “ unit moving in must stop”. On the right we moved an Elite unit over the hill near the enemy; the hill does not block or otherwise affect the movement unlike other hexes like towns, forests or even worse, hedgerows .Page | 24 This is the board after the movement phase: Next phase: battle. We will try to eliminate the infantry unit on the left with the help of our infantry unit and armor unit. We will NOT attack the artillery with the infantry nearby (we will spend that infantry unit’s turn to remove the barbed wire hence we cannot battle this turn; removal of the barbed wire will gain us a die at the next turn attack). On the right, the Elite unit is able to attack the unit on the hill, even if it moved 2 hexes. Infantry unit on bottom -left will go first. 3 dice, Close Assault. As soon as we tell the opponent that we are going to attack his infantry unit with ours, we get a surprise Ambush. The Axis player has in hand an “Ambush” tactic card and is now able to play it against our attacking infantry unit (it can be played only against a close assault, and before the attacker rolled the attacking dice). The Ambush card permits the Axis player to be the first to attack so he rolls 3 dice against our infantry unit: STAR, GRENADE, GRENADE. We are down to 2 figures, but we were not elliminated or forced to retreat with flags, so we can now attack back with 3 dice: INFANTRY, FLAG, GRENADE. The unit retreats one hex and loses 2 figures. It’s good we did not get 2 flags, otherwise Axis would have been able to move their unit into t he forest, which protects against armor attacks with - 2 dice. Axis draws a card by the way, since it played the Ambush card. The current board is show n below. Tanks follow, attacking the infantry unit again. Good thing Axis has no more Ambush cards and we can roll our 3 dice: GRENADE, GRENADE, GRENADE, a hard to get and destructive combination. Enemy infantry unit is no more, and since the armor made a Close Assault it can begin Armor Overrun.Page | 25 First it Takes Ground (moves on the hex previously occupied by enemy infantry) and is able to attack again, if there is any enemy in range. Of course we choose to attack Artillery again, even if only with 1 die (3 dice normal tank attack – 2 dice town prot ection). The armor unit is lucky again: GRENADE puts an end to the artillery unit which becomes a medal for the Allied side. Only 5 more to go. Since there are no more units in the town, the Sandbags are removed (they always are as soon as a unit leaves a hex either because it moves, it retreats or is eliminated). The remaining infantry unit on the left near the town has nobody to attack this turn (we didn’t expect such a powerful attack). Artillery is gone away, and we also cannot attack the infantry unit with the sandbags (2 normal attack at this distance – 1 for sandbags -1 because we are fighting from a wire hex = 0 so we cannot carry any attack). We will just remove the wire. On the right, we still have an attack to carry out. Our Elites use 2 dice (no rmal 3 for a Close Assault - 1 for enemy on Hill hex ): STAR, ARMOR. Enemy unit is untouched, but overall we got quite a nice attack this turn. Allied player draws a new card.Page | 26 MOVE 4 – AXIS PLAYER Axis gets lucky and plays “Air Power”. He can choose a maximum of 4 Allied units which are group ed (adjacent) and attack them one by one. The only downside: when playing this card, Axis only rolls 1 die per unit, Allied would roll 2 dice per unit. Axis chooses 4 units from the group in the bottom -right corner : elite infantry, the 2 normal infantry unit and the leftmost armor unit. One by one, these units will be attacked with 1 die. Axis rolls INFANTRY for the elite unit. Elite unit down to 3 figures. Axis rolls FLAG for the left normal infantry unit. Unit ret reats (it would retreat even if protected by sandbags or bunkers, since the card tells us “Flags may not be ignored” ). Good thing it has an available hex to retreat. Axis rolls FLAG again for the right normal infantry unit. Nowhere to retreat, the unit go es down to 3 figures Axis rolls STAR for the left armor unit, which is a miss. No change. The turn ends, Axis draws another card, the board is now:Page | 27 MOVE 5 – ALLIED PLAYER Allied plays now “Their Finest Hour”. This special card, as outlined in the first part of this document, allows us to order units depending on some dice. First, since thi s scenario gives Allies 6 cards , we ’ll roll 6 dice. We get: - FLAG – ignored - STAR – order 1 unit of our choice (we choose armor) - GRENADE – ignored - INFANTRY – order 1 infantry unit - INFANTRY – order 1 infantry unit - ARMOR – order 1 armor unit Of course, if we have no available infantry or armor units, we ignore the respective symbols. With this dice we get a total of 2 INF, 2 ARMOR. With this information in hand we sta rt choosing the units that will be ordered (can be chosen from anywhere on the board). These will be ordered, they will move/battle according to normal rules + 1 additional die for every attack . After the turn is over, the face down cards and discard deck is reshuffled together. Allied player draws a new card. [….] The game goes on as explained until one player gets 6 medals. As soon as a player gets its 6 th medal, the game ends immediately. In this scenario it also ends immediately if the Allied player ma nages to move 3 of his units to 3 of the 4 Toulon town hexes (sudden death winning condition). There are no objectives in this scenario so medals are won only by eliminating enemy units (one medal per enemy unit). In other scenarios, like Pegasus Bridge, t here are objectives/medals on the map. They may be Permanent objectives (once a unit manages to get on an objective hex it wins the medal placed on that hex and it can leave the hex without losing the medal) or Temporary objectives (in order to win such a medal, a unit must move on the objective hex and REMAIN there; if it is eliminated, retreats or moves away, the medal is returned from the player to the hex and must be won again). IN THE END I hope this document will help any Memoir ’44 beginner have a better experience playing this game, as well as get a better understanding of various rules and cards . As stated in the introduction, the rulebook remains the primary source of information and the FAQs are very important once a player gets into later scenarios and starts meeting different weird situations tha t need explaining. For any corrections or improvements please contact me on BGG. The stage is set, the battle lines are drawn, and you are in command.

The British, Canadian and Indian forces of Major-General Christopher Michael Maltby, supplemented bythe Hong Kong Volunteer Defence Forces, did their best to resist the Japanese invasion, despite being vastly outnumbered and facingthe much more battle-weathered troops of General Takashi\\'s 38th Division. By December 13, the last of the Commonwealth forces on the mainland, the Indian Rajputs, had retreated to Hong Kong Island, where Major-General Maltby organized the defense. On the 18th, the Japanese crossed the Strait, landing on the northeast of the island andsoon captured the Sai Wan Battery. Fierce fighting continued, but within 2 days, the island\\'s defense forces were hopelessly divided. They nonetheless held until Christmas day, when, running out of water and ammunition, British Colonial officials led by the Governor of Hong Kong, surrendered. This was thefirst time in history that a British Crown Colony was surrendering to an invading force. The garrison had held out for 17 long days.

Armored amphibious tanks came ashore ahead of the infantry waves of the 1st, 5th and 7thMarines. But the bombardment had failed to destroy Colonel Kunio Nakagawa\\'s soldiers and artillery resistance on theisland. Soon, their enfilading artillery and anti-boat gun fire inflicted severe vehicle losses on the LVTs. On the far left, the 1st Marines, led by Guadalcanal veteran, Captain George P. Hunt, flushed out the Japanese troops holed up in the caves of the \\'Point\\'. In the center the 5th Marines met scattered resistance and moved inland towardthe airfield.

Scenario #10927 PT32Defense of Meiktila - Burma Campaign Setup order 1 x2 2 x6 3 x3 4 x1 5 x11 6 x8 7 x2 Meiktila Historical Background By early March of 1945, the 17th Indian Division in Burma, under the command of British Major-General David Tennent \"Punch\" Cowan captured the city of Meiktila, taking just 4 days to defeat the nearly 4000 Japanese who held it. The Japanese 18th and 49th Divisions, who originally had been sent to reinforce the city, were now asked to retake it. The arriving Japanese, having been involved in heavy fighting in the preceding weeks, were weakened and only able to muster about 12,000 men. The early attacks from the Japanese from the north and west were unsuccessful and they turned their attention to the airfield east of the town. Cowan\\'s defenders, who numbered 15,000 before the battle, were being reinforced with both men and munitions as the Indian 9thInfantry Brigade continued their airlift support, even through heavy enemy fire. Japanese progress towards the airfield continued topressure the incoming flights, finally forcing Cowan to halt air landings and resort to parachute supply drops. However, the Allied air superiority, coupled with poor communications between the two Japanese divisions made it difficult for them to coordinate their attacks. Cowan kept up a vigorous and aggressive defense, sending out tank sweeps to force the Japanese to retire fromthe airfield and stall the siege.

These are the lessons I’ve learned in my first six games of Mem ’44 (note: haven’t played with artillery yet). There\\'s a bit of luck, no question, with this card-driven order system, but there is also a good deal of strategy. - Let’s get this obvious one out of the way: bisectional units do it both ways. Given the choice, a unit on a split hex has options. OK, we all know this. - Wait for it... Take advantage of Airpower. Wait for your opponent to line up 4 units adjacent to each other and then thin them out with airpower. Unless you simply MUST play a Flank card, take advantage of the situation and use the Airpower card on no less than 3 units. - Buy yourself time: If most of your units are in one section, move your other units away from potential harm to a “safe” place and let them hide while you wait for the cards you need. - On that note, use the “Recon” card that allows you to draw 2 Command cards and choose the one you want. Even though you can only command 1 unit, the CC benefit is worth it - Plan offenses two turns ahead. Make sure you have at least two of the cards you need to operate an offensive. You may be tempted to jump at an opportunity in front of you, but if you don’t have a Tactics or section card that you need to continue on the turn after, you probably should hold off. In fact, it may be a trap. - Traps, traps, and more traps! I’m a big fan of setting and springing traps: o The surprise offensive: I like to have one section card (e.g., 3 on the Left) and one Tactics card (e.g., Infantry Assault) ready to go. Before I play the trap, I get my poker face on, sigh, and play a card on another flank where I only have a few forces. Might do this two turns in a row to really set him up. My opponent thinks I must not have the cards I need, then the next turn I spring Infantry Assault (or some other special card) which surprises him and puts me on the offensive, hopefully inflicting some decent casualties. Next turn, I follow up with 3 (or better yet ALL) on the intended Flank. Or the reverse, whatever, but the Flank and Tactics card combo is a powerful 1-2 punch. If I’m lucky, I drew another card on those two turns that enables me to continue the offensive in some way. o The Firefight -- another trap: position your units at a distance from enemy units. Forego the opportunity to close assault them and use the Firefight card to blast your opponent. He may think you have a couple units who can hit him at 2 dice each when in reality it\\'s 3 dice each b/c of the Firefight card. o The sucker punch/wounded duckling: this goes with the Firefight above – take a unit and charge him at your opponent or leave him in the open. If you can afford it, make it a wounded unit (too hard to resist). Let your opponent attack and then respond with Firefight and the additional die (or some other such Tactics card you have at the ready). I’ve seen my opponent reduce my unit to 1 figure and retreat it only to be torn to pieces by the firefight that he didn’t realize he walked into. - Target the weakling and take nothing for granted: Better to go after one unit with too much force than to spread it out. I prefer to go after a 3-figure unit with 8 dice rather than 6 and use the other 2 for another attack. I’ve seen too many times how Flags actually help a player move an almost eliminated unit out of harm’s way OR see him replenish the unit with “Medics & Mechanics” (the turn after I killed 3 of them! Urgh). - Keep your tanks at a distance. Since tanks fire into terrain at -2, they’re best served pouncing on units in the open. Use infantry to protect tanks (I know, counter-intuitive) and hold your tanks back until the opportunity for maximum damage presents itself. There are only 3 tanks in a unit; use them judiciously. - Vary your strategy. Poise your units in one flank for an offensive and your others for defense but actually spring your offensive from the \"defensive\" position. There\\'s much to be said for keeping an opponent off-balance and not sure of what to expect. - Talk up your traps after you’ve sprung them the first time. When an opponent has a trap sprung on him, he learns to expect it so the next time he sees you laying off, he may think you’re setting a trap when in reality you just don’t have sh*t in your hand. And once you spring the trap the first time, it won’t be as effective, so you may as well use it for the mind-game. - Remember that you’re playing a card game as much as a board game. Keep your poker face on. Don’t put your right flank cards on the right of your tray, etc. Don’t give your opponent an idea as to how many or what type of each card you have. A friend of mine sighs, moans, and bitches about his cards all the time and then “reluctantly” plays a move 3 units card in the section where I least want it. Bastard had me thinking I was safe there. - Finally, always pull a \"Direct from HQ\" card when you need it.'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":52}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Reseñas"],"metadata":{"id":"7r9dlZ9-ldbi"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### Reseña 1 (foro BGG)"],"metadata":{"id":"k8u01qRdMIr8"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Se espera la reseña más comentada del foro\n","url_hilo_reseña_1 = 'https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/210087/memoir-44-a-detailed-review'\n","hilo_reseña_1 = extraer_comentarios_foro(url_hilo_reseña_1)"],"metadata":{"id":"A46HmUjqkq2Q","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1739498472993,"user_tz":180,"elapsed":4066,"user":{"displayName":"Facundo López Crespo","userId":"17242818259053124562"}}},"execution_count":35,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["len(hilo_reseña_1)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"DuMuocKAMz0H","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1739498474936,"user_tz":180,"elapsed":3,"user":{"displayName":"Facundo López Crespo","userId":"17242818259053124562"}},"outputId":"a9a89df5-8777-4486-9248-5bc6f6147539"},"execution_count":36,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["27"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":36}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Se aplica este método porque únicamente interesa el primer comentario que a su vez está dividido en varias de las etiquetas utilizadas para extraer los comentarios\n","reseña_1_crudo = ' '.join(hilo_reseña_1[:27])\n","reseña_1 = limpiar_texto(reseña_1_crudo)"],"metadata":{"id":"8IEfCAesHhPt","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1739498486096,"user_tz":180,"elapsed":310,"user":{"displayName":"Facundo López Crespo","userId":"17242818259053124562"}}},"execution_count":38,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["reseña_1"],"metadata":{"id":"jBtqhrNvk2vN","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1739498488823,"user_tz":180,"elapsed":685,"user":{"displayName":"Facundo López Crespo","userId":"17242818259053124562"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":200},"outputId":"74f627e5-a0df-47ac-cca6-bc959f4365e8"},"execution_count":39,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["\"This review is the first detailed review I have attempted. I have tried to make this, part review and part resource, for anyone not totally familiar with the game. For this reason I expect readers to skip to the sections that are of most interest. Image Courtesy of Erich Summary Game Type - Board Game Play Time : 20-60 minutes Number of Players: 2-8 (Most commonly 2 players) Mechanics - Card Driven, Scenario Based, Dice Rolling Combat Difficulty - Moderate (Takes 6-12 plays to become totally familiar) Components - Very Good This is the first game I have revisited to do a more in depth analysis, as my first review was minimal to say the least. With over 200 plays of Memoir and the recent announcement of the Air Pack and further expansions, I felt the time was right to revisit the base game. Overview Memoir '44 is the 2nd game to be released in the 'Commands & Colours' System and like other games in the series Memoir is a scenario based board game. As the title suggests, the theme and setting for Memoir is WWII, and more specifically the D-Day landings and battles that took place in 1944. The majority of the scenarios feature the Germans and Americans although other countries are introduced through the use of Special Forces units. The game uses a double sided, six fold board to represent the battlefield and tile overlays are used to represent terrain. Miniatures are used to represent the forces (units) present in each battle. But more on the components later. Units are ordered through the use of Command Cards and these represent the orders issued by HQ to the troops on the front. Icon dice are then used to determine the results of each attack. Each scenario has a listed victory condition in terms of the number of medals that must be captured by each side. Medals can be won by eliminating enemy units or capturing scenario objectives. The base game offers a total of 16 Scenarios. Given that Memoir plays best by playing both sides (see below) and this takes time, Memoir offers pretty good value in terms of the time it will spend on the table. The game features two sides representing the Axis and the Allies, so 2 Player games are most common. However it is possible to play using teams and this can be a great way to teach new players as a team can assess their cards together and discuss possible orders and plans. Time to get out of the HQ tent and down into the Bunker. The System Memoir uses Command Cards to drive the play and these represent the orders issued to your troops. So in effect each player is acting as a General in charge of the troops. Each scenario outlines how many cards each side will receive and these are not always equal. This helps to reflect the nature of each battle. Elements such as surprise, planning, or a lack of reconnaissance can be reflected in the number of Command Cards a side receives. This thematic element isn't made highly obvious by the game itself, but it is the conclusion I have come to with experience. It makes the theme of the game more 'real' for me and this increases my enjoyment. Once a scenario is set-up, the play is actually pretty straight forward. The play is turn based and the side to go first is outlined in the scenario. Each turn begins by playing a Command Card from your hand of available cards. Each Command Card allows a set of orders to be issued and these usually result in moving troops and firing on the enemy. Dice are rolled to resolve each attack, casualties are eliminated and medals are possibly won. The number of dice to be rolled is determined by the unit firing, the range and any modifiers for terrain effects or special battlefield conditions (cover, troop type, etc). At the end of a player's turn they will check to see if they have won the medals required for victory. If not the scenario continues and the turn is completed by drawing a replacement Command Card from the deck. Now it's time for the enemy to return fire. The Battlefield - The Board in more Detail Memoir offers a double sided, 6-fold board. One side depicts a grassy field, representing the fields of Western Europe, whilst the other side depicts a beach head, comprised of sea, beach and grass area. The board therefore allows the game to depict battles in two separate settings - inland and beach landings. The board is entirely made up of hexes and only 1 unit is allowed per hex. There are 2 red dotted lines, which serve to break the battlefield up into 3 different sections (left, right and centre). This allows the Command Cards to refer to one or more sections of the battlefield, for the purposes of issuing orders. This is all very simple but also very effective. The final feature of the board is the 6 illustrations of medals at the foot of each Side's board. These are used to track how many medals a side has won. Images Courtesy of EndersGame The Units Memoir '44 offers a total of 3 basic troop types - Infantry, Armour and Artillery. Each troop type is represented by a generic figure made from soft plastic and these are functional. They won't impress the heavy war gamer or WWII historical expert out there but they are more than satisfying for the average gamer like me. Had Memoir gone down the alternate path of tokens and chits I don't think either you or I would be in this space right now. The forces in Memoir are always formed into units. Infantry units feature 4 figures, Armour units feature 3 figures and Artillery units are made up of 2 figures (special units may differ). Units can never be mixed or moved through one another and weakened units can never band together. Weakened units still roll the same number of battle dice as a fresh unit too. These movement and combat rules are not totally satisfying as they don't represent the reality of war (more on that later) but I understand why it was done. In my opinion, Memoir was designed to reach the mass market, light to medium gamer. I think it was aimed at filling the space between Euro's and War Games (feel free to line me up with your Sniper Rifle if you wish). Complicating the rules on how units interact would have potentially alienated that target audience. So the rules on the units are a result of function over form. Each hit on a unit results in 1 figure being removed. When the last figure of a unit is eliminated, the unit is destroyed and the last figure acts as a medal that has been won, adding towards your victory condition. Let's look at the units in detail - Infantry Movement - Infantry can move 1 hex and fire or they can move 2 hexes and not fire. Range and Combat - Infantry can shoot up to 3 hexes away and get 3, 2, or 1 dice in battle based on the range. The number of dice rolled can then be affected by terrain, special orders or special conditions. Taking Ground - If an infantry unit attack a target in an adjacent hex and the target are eliminated or forced to retreat, the attacking unit can 'Take Ground' by moving into the enemies' vacated hex. Image Courtesy of ricmadeira Armour (Tanks) Movement - Armour can move up to 3 hexes per turn before firing. Range and Combat - Armour have a range of 3 hexes but they allows roll 3 dice in combat before applying any modifiers. Armour Overrun - If an Armour unit attacks a target in an adjacent hex and the target are eliminated or forced to retreat, the attacking unit can 'Armour Overrun'. This allows the Armour unit to move into the vacated hex and attack again if an enemy unit is within range. This can be a devastating play and many a scenario has been won and lost by using multiple Armour Overruns. It is crucial to know how to use them and avoid them. Image Courtesy of Toynan Artillery Movement - Artillery are not highly mobile. They can only move 1 hex per turn and if they do they cannot fire for that turn. Range and Combat - Artillery can fire as far as 6 hexes away. They get 3 battle dice for a range of 1-2, 2 battle dice for a range of 3-4 and 1 battle dice for a range of 5-6 hexes. Most importantly, Artillery never suffer modifiers for terrain or cover. This makes them deadly if well positioned. Image Courtesy of Solamar Special Forces are introduced with the use of tokens that are placed in a hex along with the unit. The special forces featured in the base game include - British Commandos - These units are allowed to move 2 hexes and still battle. Rangers - These can also move up to 2 hexes and still battle. Axis Special Forces Tanks - Each unit has 4 figures instead of 3. French Resistance - Only have 3 figures per unit but they can enter terrain hexes and still battle. When forced to retreat they can elect to move back up to 3 hexes as opposed to the usual 1 hex. These units can seem like wraiths at times and can be very hard to earn medals from. Panzer Grenadiers - Can move up to 2 hexes and still battle. British Airborne - Can move up to 2 hexes and still battle. It becomes apparent from the list of units that there is much repetition of abilities and this is also replicated below in the effects of various terrain types. I have many thoughts here but I'll hold them back for my conclusions at the end. Image Courtesy of EndersGame The Terrain Tiles Of course a plain battlefield is rather dull, so Memoir uses terrain tile overlays. There are 44 Terrain Tiles in total and they are all double sided. Each tile is hex shaped so they can fit perfectly onto any hex on the game board. The tiles are of a good thickness, meaning they will stand up to hundreds of plays. The artwork is good but not great (the Battle Lore tiles make Memoir's look a little plain by comparison). Each scenario outlines how many terrain tiles of each type are needed and where they need to go. Some scenarios are heavy on the terrain, so a set-up order for the terrain tiles is included. This outlines the order in which you should place the tiles to ensure you don't run out of any one terrain. In all the base game offers the following terrain - Forests Movement - Units that enter a Forest hex cannot battle on that turn and they must stop immediately. Line of Sight - Forests always block line of sight. Battle - Infantry suffer a -1 dice penalty for firing into Forest hexes whilst Armour suffer a -2 dice penalty. Hills Movement - A hill imposes no movement restrictions unless stated in the scenario notes. Line of Sight - Hills block line of sight for units on ground level. Any unit on a hill will not be able to see a unit on the ground if the hill is 2 or more hexes in length and the unit is located at the base of those hills. This rule is not outlined in the rules and can be found on many forums including the Geek. Battle - Any Infantry or Armour unit firing at a target on a hill (higher ground) will suffer a -1 dice penalty. If an attacking unit is on a hill and fires at another unit on a hill, it will suffer no penalty. Hedgerows Movement - Hedgerows were typical in Normandy and are the most complex terrain in the base game. To move into a Hedgerow, a unit must have started the turn adjacent to the hex they wish to move into. A unit moving into a Hedgerow will stop immediately and they cannot fire this turn. A unit moving out of a Hedgerow can only move to an adjacent hex before stopping. Line of Sight - All Hedgerows block line of sight. Battle -Infantry suffer a -1 dice penalty for firing into a Hedgerow and Armour units suffer a -2 penalty. Towns & Villages Movement - All units moving into a town or village must stop immediately and cannot battle for that turn. Line of Sight - All towns and villages block line of sight. Battle - Infantry suffer a -1 battle dice penalty for firing into a town or village, whilst Armour units suffer a -2 penalty. In addition any Armour unit firing out of a town or village will also suffer a -2 battle dice penalty. Image Courtesy of EndersGame Rivers & Waterways No units can cross rivers or waterways unless a bridge crosses them or there are special rules outlined in the scenario summary. Line of sight and battle restrictions do not apply to this terrain. Oceans Units in ocean hexes are considered to be on landing craft of one kind or another. The maximum movement in ocean is 1 hex. Units can never battle whilst in ocean hexes and units cannot retreat into ocean hexes. Line of sight is never blocked by ocean. Beach A unit that moves onto a beach hex can only move a maximum of 2 hexes. If a unit starts on a beach hex but makes its first move onto a non-beach hex, it does not suffer the 2 hex maximum limit (I'm thinking Armour units here). Beach terrain has no effect on line of sight or battle. Image Courtesy of EndersGame Special Features In addition to the terrain, Memoir includes all of the special features we would expect from the theme in the form of smaller tiles, tokens or mini figures. Bunkers - Bunkers block line of sight but units can move into them and still battle. They are impassable to Armour and artillery and they only protect the original owner's units (the side that started with them at the beginning of the scenario) unless otherwise stated in the scenario notes. Infantry suffer a -1 battle dice penalty for attacking units in a bunker and Armour suffer a -2 penalty. Image Courtesy of EndersGame Sandbags - Sandbags allow the occupying unit to ignore the 1st flag rolled against it on each battle dice roll. Infantry attacking a unit in a sandbagged hex suffer a -1 penalty and Armour suffer a -2 penalty. If a sandbag installation is ever left vacant it is removed from the field of play. Barbed Wire - Units moving into barbed wire must stop but they can still battle. Armour will destroy the barbed wire removing it from the board, but infantry will battle out at a -1 penalty. An infantry unit can choose to remove barbed wire instead of battling. Therefore a unit that moves 2 spaces to reach a hex with barbed wire cannot remove it as they don't have the option to fire. Hedgehogs - Infantry may move in and through hedgehogs with no movement or battle restriction. Infantry in a hex with hedgehogs may also ignore the 1st flag rolled against them in each attack. Armour and Artillery units cannot enter a hex with hedgehogs. Image Courtesy of EndersGame Combat and the Battle Dice I have touched on combat in terms of the dice rolled by units at various points in this review already but I'll go through the process in its entirety here. Before I begin it is very important to note that all units must move before any firing can begin. As soon as any one unit makes an attack roll, no other units may fire. All units then fire independent of each other. By that I mean if one hex is targeted by multiple units, they do no roll their attack as one. Each attack is rolled separately and resolved before the next attack begins. A set firing order does not need to be made by a player. Each attack can be made and resolved before the next begins. In this way a clever player can attack with their units in such a way as to allow for potential foul-ups and cover multiple bases at the same time. LOS - When a unit wishes to attack they must first identify if they have Line of Sight (LOS) to the target. Terrain may block line of sight and units can also block line of sight to other units. Generally it is accepted that line of sight should be traced from the middle of the attacking hex to the middle of the target hex. If any part of that line can be traced through an LOS blocking hex, the target is not valid. Often a LOS check will be drawn perfectly between 2 hexes. As long as one of those hexes is not blocking LOS, the target is valid. Number of Battle Dice - Next you must determine how many dice you can roll for the attack. This is determined by calculating the range of the attack and identifying how many dice your unit type can roll at that range (if any). From this total you may have to deduct a number of dice for terrain or other features that effect battle. This may sound complex in print, but Memoir provides a number of summary cards that outline all of these considerations very easily. After just a few games it becomes second nature very quickly. The Battle Dice - Now it is time to roll the dice for the attack. Each Battle Dice features the following icons - Infantry Icon - x2 Armour Icon - x1 Grenade - x1 Flag - x1 Star - x1 One hit or casualty is scored for every icon rolled that matches the unit type being attacked. In addition the grenade icon counts as a hit against anything. So immediately it becomes apparent that their is a 50% chance of hitting an infantry unit per dice. Chances of hitting a tank is 33% and hitting an artillery unit is 1 in 6 or roughly 17%. Whilst the odds may suggest always targeting the infantry, this can be folly as armour and artillery units pose such a threat. Thankfully they only have 3 and 2 figures per unit, so a little luck on the dice goes a long way. A star is a missed result, but this icon is sometimes used in other ways by special Command Cards. Image Courtesy of Yugblad Retreating - Rolling a flag results in the targeted unit fleeing 1 hex. If multiple flags are rolled in a single attack, then the unit will be forced to retreat multiple hexes. Sometimes a unit cannot retreat, due to terrain restrictions (like ocean or impassable hills) or other units may block a retreat. For every hex that a unit cannot retreat, a casualty is inflicted. Sometimes it is possible to maneuver in behind enemy units, cutting off their retreat. If flags are rolled against them it will result in further casualties, thereby increasing the chance to hit them. Retreats must always be made back towards the owning player's side of the board. This means that each unit has no more than 2 hexes that they can retreat into for each flag. From a reality perspective I have issues with this. What if the attack is coming from the rear? Why would my troops retreat in this direction instead of fleeing the other way? The obvious answer is that the troops will always want to retreat towards their supply lines and they are no doubt confused in the heat of battle. In the end I have come to accept this rule as part of the game. Simplicity has its place. Resolving Combat and the turn - Each hit results on a unit being removed from the unit under attack. If the last unit is removed from a unit, that unit has been eliminated. To signify this achievement, the last unit should be placed on medal icon on the edge of the board to signify that a medal has been captured. If capturing a medal means one side has meet the victory conditions for the scenario the battle is over. If this is not the case after the last attack for a turn, the player ends their turn by drawing a Command Card from the Command deck and play passes to the enemy. Firefights and Close Assaults These are two terms that directly relate to battle. A 'Firefight' is a term relating to any unit that is attack at a distance (there is also a special Tactic Card with this name - see below). The term 'Close Assault' refers to any unit that attacks another unit in an adjacent hex. If a unit ever finds itself in an adjacent hex or 'Close Assault' situation, it is required to attack that unit when it fires. It cannot choose to attack another unit that is not in an adjacent hex. This can be used to one's advantage by deliberately engaging in Close Assault with the enemy, in order to stop them from firing on another weaker unit that could earn them a medal. It also has ramifications for selecting a retreat path when flags are rolled. Know What You are Playing Memoir is a wonderful game in my opinion if you take it for what it is. Memoir '44 is not a 'War Game' in the truest sense of the term. Memoir is a Card Driven Game (CDG) and it is all about 'Hand Management'. The skill to Memoir is identifying the strength of the cards at your disposal and how they can best be played with the troops at your disposal and their relative position in relation to the enemy and surrounding terrain. Making a push in one section without adequate troop support or without enough orders (Command Cards) to see the attack through will likely leave your troops highly exposed and ripe for the slaughter. Blaming poor card draws is all too often the catch cry of someone who has not planned carefully enough or simply played the game without a full appreciation for mechanics of the game. So if Memoir is a CDG, we should look at the Command Deck. Command Deck The Command Deck is made up of 60 cards which fall into two categories. Section Cards There are a total of 40 section cards. Each section card outlines the section(s) it relates to and how many units may be ordered there. Here is a short break down - Recon - Allows 1 unit to receive an order one section (different Recon cards will refer to different sections). At the end of the turn, 2 Command Cards can be drawn instead of the usual 1 and the player can select which card they wish to keep. Probe - Allows 2 units to be ordered in any 1 section. Different Probe cards refer to different sections. Attack - Allows 3 units to be ordered in any 1 section. Different Attack cards refer to different sections. Assault - Allows all units to be ordered in any 1 section. Different Assault cards refer to different sections. Pincer Move - Allows 2 units to be ordered in both flank sections (left and right). Recon in Force - Allows 1 unit in each section to receive an order. General Advance - Allows 2 units in each section to receive an order. Image Courtesy of EndersGame It should be noted here that some hexes on the board are cut in two by the dotted red line that denotes each section. These units are considered to be in both sections and can benefit from Command Cards that refer to either section. Tactic Cards There are a total of 20 Tactic Cards and these feature a grey background to help set them apart. Each card offers a fairly powerful order (when used in the right situation) outlined by its text, and generally these cards are meant to represent detailed planning direct from the Generals at HQ. In summary these cards include - Move Out (2) - Issue orders to 4 units of Infantry, regardless of their position. Direct form HQ (2) - Issue orders to any 4 units, regardless of their position. Counter-Attack (2) - Issue the same order as the last Command Card played by your opponent. IF it was a section card, then reverse the section it relates to (in other words you must order units in the same section as those ordered by the enemy). Infantry Assault (2) - Issue orders to all infantry in 1 section. They may move up to 2 hexes and still battle or move 3 hexes and not battle. Movement and battle restrictions still apply in relation to terrain. If you do not have any Infantry units, this card allows any 1 unit to be ordered. Armour Assault (2) - Order up to 4 Armour units in any location. Each unit that attacks in 'Close Assault' may roll 1 extra dice than normal. Movement and battle restrictions still apply in relation to terrain. If you do not have any Armour units, this card allows any 1 unit to be ordered. Barrage (1) - Target any 1 enemy unit and roll 4 battle dice, ignoring terrain modifiers. Flags may not be ignored. This is perfect for targeting units behind sandbags or in bunkers. Artillery Bombard (1) - Issue an order to all Artillery units. Each unit may move up to 3 hexes or battle twice. If a player has no Artillery units, they can order any 1 unit of choice. Dig-In (1)- Allows up to 4 infantry units to receive a sandbag emplacement. If a player has no Infantry units, they can order any 1 unit of choice. Medics & Mechanics (1) - Issue an order to any 1 unit. Roll a number of battle dice equal to the number of Command Cards you currently hold (including this one). For each star or icon rolled that matches the unit type, 1 lost figure of that unit is replaced. A unit can never exceed its initial strength. As long as at least 1 unit is recovered, that unit can be ordered in the usual fashion. Close Assault (1) - All Infantry and Armour units that are adjacent to an enemy unit can attack and receive 1 additional battle dice. These units may not move but they can 'Take Ground' and perform an 'Armour Overrun' action. Firefight (1) - Allows any 4 units to fire at targets within range and receive one additional battle dice. These units may not move and they cannot be in 'Close Assault'. Ambush (1) - Can be played in the opponent's turn as soon as they declare a 'Close Assault' attack. It allows your targeted unit to attack first. If the Ambush results in the unit being eliminated or forced to retreat it cannot fight back. The player who played the Ambush card should draw a replacement card before the opponent draws a card to end their turn. Air Power (1) - Targets a group of 4 or fewer adjacent enemy units. If the Allied side uses this card, they can roll 2 dice per hex and score a hit for each dice that matches the unit type, a grenade or a star. Flags cannot be ignored. If the Axis side uses Air Power, they can roll 1 dice per hex. This reflects the weakened status of the Luftwaffe in 1944. Their Finest Hour (1) - Roll 1 battle dice for each card you currently hold (including this one). Each unit symbol rolled results in 1 unit of that type being ordered. Star results mean any unit of choice can be ordered. All ordered units can be in any location on the battlefield and they receive 1 additional dice in combat. This is potentially the most powerful card in the deck but I have lost count of how many times I have rolled poorly with 5 or 6 dice and only received 1 or 2 orders. Behind Enemy Lines (1) - I have left this card to last as it is the one card that was poorly printed and does not reflect the designer's intention. It allows any 1 Infantry unit to move up to 3 hexes, battle and move 3 additional hexes after the attack is concluded. The unit also receives 1 additional dice. The error is that the card states that terrain and battle restrictions still apply. This is not the case and makes the card very useful. Allowing an Infantry unit to move up to 3 hexes through forest or hedgerows and potentially roll 4 dice in combat is a great way to finish off a weakened unit that thought it was safe. This is a great way to earn that final medal. Image Courtesy of johncarlton The Scenarios Given that Memoir is a scenario based game, it was important that they got the scenarios right and thankfully they did. Each scenario is outlined in full colour and consists of 6 key sections. Name and Date - Outlines the name of the engagement featured by the scenario and the date it took place in 1944. Map - Features a map of the board and all of the terrain present. It also outlines the starting position for each side's units. just make sure you have the map and board in the same orientation when setting up. Set-up Order - A small sidebar that outlines how many tiles of each terrain are needed. The order of this set-up is also important as the terrain tiles are double sided. The combination of the map, this sidebar and a little experience can see a scenario set-up in as little as 5 minutes. Historical Background - I really dig this feature as each scenario features a small paragraph or two that outlines the situation. The right light, a little atmospheric music and the reading of the HB can all add to the gaming experience. Briefing - This section outlines how many Command Cards each side gets and who goes first. Conditions of Victory - This section outlines how many medals are needed for victory and all the special rules (and forces) relating to the scenario. Scenario Balance I have heard many a gamer get annoyed at some of the scenarios because they are not balanced. I have always struggled to understand this notion as there have been few battles in history that have pitted equal forces in equal conditions, with equal morale etc. But I recognise that these people are referring more to the chances of success with one side as compared to another. I think it is fairly commonly accepted that the best way to play Memoir is to have both players (or teams) play each side of a scenario. By recording the medal count and casualty count earned with each playing, a total scenario score can be calculated for each player (or team). This can then help decide who was the better player of the scenario. I personally never play Memoir without this method and I often enjoy playing the underdog more and seeing if I can reduce the margin of defeat. The main argument against using this system is time as a beginner can take up to an hour to play one side of a scenario. However with experience and having the rules fully under your belt, it is possible to play both sides of a scenario in 50-70 minutes. But for those seeking the most balanced of scenarios from the base game I give you - Scenario Analysis All stats featured here come from the Days of Wonder Battle Reports Webpages. Pegasus Bridge - With almost 1500 reports at the time of writing this the Allies had a healthy 68% win ratio. Not particularly balanced but I love trying to hold those damn Allies with the Germans sandbag nest. Saint-Mere-Eglise - With just over 850 reports at the time of writing the Allies had a healthy 63% win ratio. This is largely due to the air drop afforded the Allies and the poor unit position of the Germans. Still, get the air drop wrong and the Germans can still hurt you. Sword Beach - With just over 915 reports at the time of writing the Germans only hold a 52% win ratio. This should keep the balance freaks happy! Pointe-du-Hoc - With just over 500 reports at the time of writing the Allies had a healthy 69% win ratio. I love the nervous tension just before the Allied troops break in a wave over the cliffs. It's like watching the Liverpool midfield storm towards a hapless Derby penalty box! (See EPL results September 1st, 2007). Omaha Beach (First Assault Wave) - With almost 650 reports at the time of writing the Axis had an alarming win ratio of 80%. Balance junkies need not apply. Mont Mouchet - With just under 500 reports at the time of writing the Germans only hold a 51% win ratio making it spot on. I love playing those nimble French and watching the Axis Special Forces Armour units burn. Vassieux - With just over 300 reports at the time of writing the Axis had a healthy 61% win ratio. I love how the Allies start with a couple of exposed units from the off. Retreat little birdie, retreat! Operation Cobra - With almost 450 reports at the time of writing the Allies hold a 51% win ratio making it spot on for the Karma Police. Operation Luttich (Counterattack on Mortain) - With almost 450 reports at the time of writing the Axis hold a satisfying 55% win ratio. I love the rules regarding Hill 317. Toulon (Campaign for Southern France) - With just over 250 reports at the time of writing the Allies had a healthy 66% win ratio. I love pounding away with the German Artillery for as long as possible before falling foul of the Allied infestation. Liberation of Paris - With just over 250 reports at the time of writing the Allies had an alarming 78% win ratio. Gee who would have thunk it from the title. Montelimar (Campaign for Southern France) - With just over 300 reports at the time of writing the Allies hold a reasonable win ratio of 58%. Personally I have won twice as often with the Germans (4-2). It's all about the central hills and the town of Grane. Arnhem Bridge - With just over 275 reports at the time of writing the Allies had a demoralising win ratio of 83%. I must confess that even I have trouble liking this one but I've only given it 2 goes. Arracourt - With just over 260 reports at the time of writing the Allies had a healthy 65% win ratio. But I defy you not to enjoy this one with all those Armour and artillery units blazing away. St Vith, Ardennes - With just over 200 reports at the time of writing the Axis hold a narrow 51% win ratio. Can you feel the Yin and the Yang? Saverne Gap, Vosges - With just under 220 reports at the time of writing the Axis hold a narrow 53% win ratio. I suspect the low number of plays is mainly due to the fact that this is the last scenario in the book (not counting the Overlord scenario). That makes for 8 fairly balanced scenarios and a few others that are within the realms of acceptance. But beyond the stats, use the 'Play both sides' method and all is well. Did I Mention Scenarios (or Re-playability) Whilst this may not relate to the base game of Memoir in the truest sense, it does reflect on owning the base game. Memoir has a very strong community and there are now literally hundreds of fan designed scenarios on the web ready to download and use. This makes the game infinitely re-playable, even before looking at scenarios. The Final Word If you've made it this far and have read every word, I award you a Purple Heart, Victoria Cross or whatever other medal you desire. It's probably no surprise to hear me say I am a big fan of Memoir '44. I love the game and I always will, even when it is compared to other games in the series or elsewhere. But I've also tried to drop hints all the way through this review about its limitations. Time for the Pro's and Con's. Strengths It scratches that itch between Euro and War Game without the 3 hour-plus time frame of some larger combat based CDG's. This was a middle ground that was dying for a few titles to fill the void. The components are really very good, from the box to the rules, through to the player aids. The only thing holding me back from giving the components an excellent rating is the artillery units, which are a little flimsy. The System is excellent and whilst it has been tweaked by the likes of BattleLore, there are elements here that I think are still highly appealing. Namely... Set-up and Play Time - One of the things that puts me off BattleLore just a little (only a little) is the increased set-up and play time. Memoir for me has both of these issues nailed down beautifully. It is possible to play 3 scenarios, both ways, in 3 and a half hours. That feels satisfying. Simple - For me Memoir works thanks to its simple nature (this can also be a weakness - see below). You don't have to refer to a 50+ page rulebook to play Memoir as all of the details needed for each Scenario can be summarised on a few cards. Anything more complicated for me when I first discovered Memoir would have possibly been too much. Thanks to Memoir I am now ready to march into the likes of Tide of Iron and Twilight Struggle. Fun - The greatest test for any game. Even after 200 plays I pulled it out just last week and had a great time over 2 scenarios. Weaknesses Simplicity - Whilst I listed it as a strength above, it is also a weakness. It does irk me that so many terrains have the same effect on units. It seems to take away from the reality of the theme somewhat. Lack of Feel (reality) - After many plays the lack of reality does begin to niggle in the back of the mind. The way in which the units move and behave does not convey the real nature of WWII at all. It does feel like I am moving plastic bits around a board. This takes away from the experience and therefore makes it a weakness. Unit interaction (or lack thereof) - This leads off from the last point regarding reality. Whilst your chances of success are limited if units are not moved together in packs, it does not necessarily result in failure either. I can't begin to tell you how many times I have been successful with a single marauding Armour unit that manages to roll well and make use of an equally successful Armour Overrun. One Armour unit should not be allowed to decimate the opposition. But they can. No Continuity - Scenario play is all well and good but it would have been nice to have seen some scenarios linked together into a campaign, whereby one result would affect the outcomes and forces in future scenarios. I feel this has been a real opportunity lost and even after all this time since the release, there are still no official campaign rules of any depth (please don't raise those half hearted campaign rules that came with one of the expansions). Sigh... Where are you in your gaming journey? - Memoir is spot on for anyone who is looking for something a little different but isn't ready for a Tide of Iron or Twilight Imperium level of complexity. However for anyone else who is looking for more, Memoir in its base box form probably looks a little underdone. Having the victory condition determined purely by the number of units eliminated (in most cases) just doesn't feel right. It would have been nice to have some 'real' objectives to try and achieve other than 'kill as many of the enemy as possible'. I mean even First Person Shooter video games left that model behind at the turn of the century. In the end how much you love or hate Memoir will be a matter of personal preference, experience and opinion. I'm in the love category and I'm comfortable with that.

Por mi perfil de jugador y el de mis diversos grupos, son diseños que no nos encajan demasiado por duración y complejidad (no tanto a nivel mecánico como de asimilación del juego en sí para sacarle provecho y no actuar de forma cuasi-aleatoria). Aquí es donde entra Richard Borg, autor del juego que hoy nos ocupa y, más concretamente, de un sistema de juego que estrenase con Battle Cry (wargame sobre la Guerra Civil Americana) que, de forma ultrasimplificada, acerca esta clase de juegos a los que, como yo, nos parecen una inversión de tiempo excesiva para la satisfacción obtenida.Empezaré justificando lo que acabo de soltar en el párrafo para que contextualicéis el tocho que se avecina. Partimos de la base de que la mayoría de los wargames requieren un mínimo de unas tres horas para desarrollar una partida (y de ahí para arriba), sin incluir la explicación, que suele implicar una buena dosis de detalles puntillos que hay que refrescar durante la propia partida. Mi semana lúdica suele reducirse a una partida diaria de una hora y pico como máximo y alguna sesión durante el fin de semana, pero nada especialmente espectacular (4-5 horas como mucho). Así que, las posibilidades de encajar un juego de este tipo, ya solo por duración, son muy reducidas.Lo siguiente es la motivación. Ya sabéis que soy un eurogamer de pro y lo que a mí me motiva especialmente son más mecánicas, más allá del nivel de interacción y/o azar. Encuentro especialmente satisfactorio escudriñar nuevos diseños y ver cómo han engarzado los distintos elementos. Desde este punto de vista, los wargames no me atraen especialmente, no al menos explorar el género porque tengo el prejuicio de que todo me va a saber más o menos a lo mismo. Esto es porque creo (que me corrija algún grognard) que lo principal en un juego de estas características es la simulación y la recreación histórica. Si el interés por lo que ocurrió en la realidad no es lo suficientemente intenso, la experiencia no va a aportar gran cosa al jugador, como también ocurre con los juegos temáticos. Es necesaria esta predisposición para, supongo, disfrutar de estos diseños. Predisposición de la que habitualmente carezco. De hecho, en mi caso suele ocurrir al revés, y es gracias al juego cuando me intereso por acontecimientos históricos, como ya me ocurriese con Twilight Struggle (aquí su tochorreseña) o A Few Acres of Snow, por poner un par de ejemplos que, sin ser wargames (al menos de forma estricta), sí que tienen esta componente histórica.Supongo que el señor Borg pensó esto mismo y prefirió alejarse de estos wargames tan absorbentes y optar por un diseño mucho más directo y sencillo, con las simplificaciones justas para mantener un mínimo de simulación, pero sin perderse en mil condicionantes. A esto le unimos una casa como Days of Wonder que, si por algo se caracteriza es por ofrecer juegos asequibles (familiares en su mayoría) y lo aderezamos con el evento histórico que mayor tratamiento ha tenido desde que ocurriese, esto es, la Segunda Guerra Mundial, tenemos la receta del juego que hoy nos ocupa. He de confesar que son estos últimos dos aspectos los que me hicieron acercarme a Memoir ’44. Vamos a ver qué me encontré.¿Y qué nos encontramos cuando abrimos la caja? Pues un tablero a doble cara, unas cuantas losetas con elementos geográficos, unos pocos dados con símbolos en sus caras, algunos tokens un mazo de cartas con no demasiado texto y un montón de miniaturas que vienen a sustituir a los counters, destacando las de infantería y carros blindados. Y con esto el señor Borg nos ofrece un diseño que no solo funciona a las mil maravillas, sino que es capaz de recrear hasta 16 batallas históricas acontecidas en la mayor contienda bélica de la historia (hasta el momento). Y, como ya he dejado caer, de una forma tremendamente sencilla.Memoir ’44 se encuentra dentro de los wargames tácticos, siendo su mecanismo principal es el famoso Motor de Cartas, una submecánica de la gestión de mano mediante la cual los jugadores asignan órdenes a las distintas unidades disponibles en función de las cartas que actualmente poseen, limitando el margen de maniobra y evitando los colapsos mentales cuando no hay barreras a la hora de actuar. El turno de un jugador es tan simple como escoger una de las cartas que posee, aplicar sus efectos y dejar paso a su rival.Es cierto que estas cartas y los diversos condicionantes podrían complicarse hasta el infinito, pero no es el caso. En el mazo encontramos dos tipos de cartas. Una, las de sección, que son las más fáciles de aplicar ya que no hay ni que leer texto, indican cuantas unidades pueden activarse en los distintos flancos. Las otras, las de táctica, sin aplican efectos algo más elaborados, pero que no dejan de ser ligeras modificaciones sobre lo que podría llevarse a cabo con las cartas de sección.El resto del turno se reduce a desplazar a activar las unidades correspondientes, desplazándolas y/o entrando en combate contra unidades enemigas. Y tanto lo uno como lo otro se resuelve de forma tremendamente ágil. Cada unidad (solo hay tres tipos) poseen unas determinadas características de desplazamiento (número de casillas sobre las que pueden desplazarse), puntos de vida (número de miniaturas) alcance (distancia a la que podrían atacar a un objetivo rival) y potencia de fuego (número de dados que se van a lanzar para resolver el combate). A estas características hay que añadirle las modificaciones del terreno que, si bien podrían parecer bastantes, se resumen en unas pocas cartas que nos ahorran el tener que estar consultando al manual si aún no nos hemos aprendido de memoria dichas características. Una vez ajustado, por cada unidad que ataque se lanzan los dados y se aplican las bajas: una miniatura retirada por cada símbolo que aplique sobre dicha unidad. Y así, turno a turno, se desarrolla la partida hasta que uno de los dos contendientes alcanza la condición de victoria, que en la mayoría de escenarios consiste en alcanzar una serie de puntos de victoria. Puntos que, por lo general, se obtendrán eliminando unidades rivales.Como veis, nada especialmente complejo y que se explica de forma ágil, sin necesidad de entrar a abordar toda la casuística posible. Basta con indicar los condicionantes que aplican sobre el escenario y a jugar, ya que raro es el despliegue en el que haya de todo. Así que, en este sentido, fuera miedos, ya que Memoir ’44 es un juego realmente asequible, sobre todo comparado con eurogames densos como podrían ser los del señor Lacerda: Vinhos (aquí su tochorreseña) o Kanban (aquí su tochorreseña). Es, sin duda, esta agilidad lo que nos enganchará de inicio, mientras que el resto nos irá enamorando poco a poco.Y es que, a medida que uno acumula partidas, se da cuenta de lo versátil del sistema y la capacidad de implementar esas batallas de forma relativamente fidedigna sin necesidad de alcanzar un nivel de simulación profundo que pueda abrumar al jugador ocasional. Es cierto que cada escenario tiene sus peculiaridades, pero se resumen en un pequeño párrafo y no suponen una alteración demasiado importante de las normas estándar.Pongamos algunos ejemplos. Los terrenos que permiten a la infantería resguardarse provocan que los blindados pierdan capacidad de fuego contra ellos (bosques, ciudades, etc.) pero, a su vez, dificultan el tránsito de la propia infantería al encontrarse en un terreno más dificultoso. O las alambradas, que frenan en seco a la infantería, teniendo que emplear dos turnos (uno en entrar y otro en salir), mientras que los blindados pueden arrasar con el metal espinado como si no existiese. O las defensas anticarro, que impiden el tránsito de los blindados, pero pueden servir como protección a las unidades de infantería, reduciendo las probabilidades de tener que retirarse ante una ráfaga enemiga. Todo esto está resumido en unas pocas cartas de referencia que memorizaremos en un par de partidas (basta con aplicar el concepto una o dos veces en un escenario y ya quedará grabado a fuego en nuestra mente).Al final, lo fundamental es saber leer el escenario y asumir el papel que corresponda. Normalmente hay un bando que, por situación, debe tomar la ofensiva, mientras que el otro debe culebrear y buscar las oportunidades de ir anotando puntos con paciencia, tirando de picardía. David contra Goliat. No tiene por qué ganar el más fuerte, pero ser el más fuerte suele ser una ventaja difícil de superar.Todo esto está muy bien, pero hay que lanzar una advertencia especialmente dirigida a los amantes del control. Memoir ’44 es un juego con un factor de azar elevado. Muy elevado. Ya puedes maniobrar de forma impecable, que, si la dama fortuna decide darte la espalda, vas a tener realmente complicado hacerte con la victoria. Para empezar, la aleatoriedad propia de un mazo de cartas. Recordemos que dichas cartas aplican sobre flancos concretos o bajo ciertas circunstancias. Pues bien, si la disposición en el tablero no concuerda con lo que tenemos en mano, puedes llegar incluso a bloquearte, viéndote obligado a «perder» un turno jugando una carta con la que no puedes activar ninguna unidad únicamente para robar una nueva carta.A esto le añadimos el azar típico de las tiradas de dados. Es cierto que las condiciones en las que dichas tiradas se efectúan sí que pueden estar bajo control (terreno, distancia, línea de visión, potencia, etc.). Pero siempre tendremos al típico colega con mano de eurogamer que no le sale un éxito ni harto de vino. Y sin causar estragos en las unidades enemigas, la victoria se pone un pelín cuestarriba. Así que ojo con esto, que más de uno puede acabar desesperado. Afortunadamente, una partida de Memoir ’44 rara vez supera la hora de duración, así que siempre nos quedará la opción de la revancha inmediata.Es por esto que muchos jugadores optan por jugar dos veces seguidas el mismo escenario, alternando bandos, de forma que cada uno puede demostrar su valía en ambas situaciones, tomando como resultado final bajas causadas en ambas partidas, como si de una eliminatoria a ida y vuelta se tratase.Con todo, Memoir ’44 es un magnifico juego que, además de servir como iniciación al mundo de los wargames, puede colmar la curiosidad de muchos jugadores, no necesitando profundizar mucho más allá. Por establecer un caso similar, Memoir ’44 sería el Stone Age (aquí su tochorreseña) de los juegos de colocación de trabajadores. Sirve perfectamente para saber si el diseño encaja con tus gustos, pero muchos no querrán ir más allá y les bastará con el juego de la edad de piedra.Como ya supondréis, la rejugabilidad es más que destacable al incluir el juego básico un total de 16 escenarios asimétricos, de forma que cada uno se puede jugar un mínimo de dos veces con cada bando. Treinta y dos partidas amortizarían sobradamente el juego. Además, cada escenario tiene un sabor propio, permitiéndonos profundizar en el acontecimiento histórico recurriendo a la Wikipedia tras la victoria o derrota para ver cómo se desarrolló en la realidad. Pero, por si no fuese suficiente, en la página oficial de la editorial podemos encontrar numerosos escenarios diseñados por los jugadores, además de los diversos packs de expansión que añaden, además de batallas, nuevas unidades, terrenos y normas. ¡Como para aburrirse!En el tema de la escalabilidad, si bien el juego permite formar equipos, yo solo lo concibo como un diseño a dos jugadores. Eso de dividir funciones entre varias cabezas pensantes es algo que no termina de encajarme (ni en este ni en otros juegos).Pasemos a la edición. Si por algo se caracteriza Days of Wonder es por ofrecernos unas ediciones cuidadas al milímetro. Y Memoir ’44 no es ninguna excepción. Los elementos de cartón tienen el suficiente grosor como para resistir el paso de las partidas, si bien es cierto que la lámina externa es demasiado porosa para mi gusto. Cuidado con derramar cualquier liquido sobre alguno de estos componentes, pues tiene pinta de absorber tanto como una bayeta. En las miniaturas hay luces y sombras, ya que, si bien las de infantería y blindados son densas y consistentes, las de artillería o las defensas anticarro deben ser tratadas con mimo si no queremos estropicios. Como curiosidad, destacar la exagerada escala de la miniatura que representa el alambre de espino, más grande que una miniatura de infantería. Las cartas son de una calidad excelsa, con un gramaje supremo, una resistencia elástica que permitiría usarlas como trampolín y una textura lisa muy agradable. Como siempre, recomiendo el enfundado, ya que las cartas se barajan bastante, aun incluyéndose unos prácticos sujeta-cartas que nos evitarán tener que estar manoseándolas. Los dados de madera están completamente pintados y tienen un peso aceptable. Por último, el reglamento es un ejemplo de claridad a la hora de explicar los diferentes conceptos. Con una lectura se hace uno rápidamente con la mecánica, sobre todo gracias a los numerosos ejemplos que complementan el texto.Aquí me gustaría detenerme en un par de aspectos que afean el conjunto global. En primer lugar, el tema de las losetas a doble cara. Es cierto que ahorran espacio, pero preparar ciertos escenarios exige un ejercicio de prueba y error hasta dar con la combinación correcta de losetas según su cara, dándose situaciones del tipo «no puedo completar el rio porque las losetas de bosque que había colocado contienen los tramos de agua que me faltan». El otro tema es el de marcar las unidades que se han desplazado. Durante el turno, el movimiento de las unidades activadas se completa antes de proceder a atacar. Si activamos bastantes unidades (3 o más) y en el tablero hay una gran densidad de las mismas, es fácil despistarse y no tener claro cuales se han movido y tienen opción a combatir. No habría estado mal la inclusión de algunos marcadores para indicar esto.En cuanto al arte, solo puedo tener buenas palabras. La portada tiene un tono adecuado al juego que contiene, utilizando un estilo cómic que, si bien podría restar importancia al tema tratado, ya nos pone en situación. Es un juego de guerra, pero un juego de guerra para todos los públicos. Los elementos del terreno son bastante atractivos para ser simplemente detalles del terreno. También son destacables las ilustraciones de las cartas, en especial las de tácticas, cada una con un dibujo distinto acorde al efecto y título de las mismas.Y vamos cerrando. Memoir ’44 es el juego perfecto de iniciación a los wargames tácticos, con un sistema tremendamente asequible, divertido y ágil que lo hace apto para todos los públicos sin mermar demasiado el componente de simulación histórica. Además, es tan versátil que permite representar numerosos escenarios sin necesidad de aplicar excesivas variantes a las reglas generales. Tal vez la mayor pega que se le puede encontrar es una influencia del azar que muchos pueden considerar excesiva, además de un flujo de turno al que tal vez le convendría una pequeña pensada para evitar confusiones.

days of Wonder is a game for twoplayers or team play approximate playtime of 30 to 60 Minutes recommended forages eight and up Memoir 44 basicallyair drops you into the key battles toturn the tide in Western Europe duringWorld War to You'll command your troopsin battlefields that Define the historyof the 20th century the goal of the gameis dependent on the mission the playersare playing the rule book gives you 16missions a victory in the game willinvolve you obtaining a set number ofVictory medals uh which can be obtainedmainly by erasing enemy units ordepending again on the mission thingslike capturing points so let's have alook at a basic overview of how the gameis played the board is set up into threemain sections divided by Red de lineseach Mission will have you set up theterrain in a way that reflects ahistorical battle here I have an exampleof some of the terrain we have townsforests hros and a river each piece ofterrain will affect the elements of thegame like movement line of sight andcover from incoming fire players willthen Place Miniatures again according tothe mission setup here the Miniaturesare represented by shapes circles areinfantry rectangles are tanks and theupside down V represent artillery eachtime a wound is caused to a unit oneminiature for each wound will be removedfrom that unit so a tank unit obviouslyhas three wounds infantry 4 andartillery 2 when a unit is wiped outcompletely the attacking player holds onto the last miniature as a Victory Medalthe starting player will play a cardfrom his hand cards will activate unitsso this card will activate all units inthe Left Flank this card will activateone unit in the center and when heredraws a card at the end of his turn hewill be able to redraw two and pick theone that he thinks will benefit him mostif green chooses a center card he willbe able to activate one unit within thisarea the unit he chooses to order canthen move an infantry unit can move onehex and still battle or two hex's andnot battle green chooses to move thisunit only one hex the ordered unitsafter movement can then battle aninfantry unit can battle up to threehex's way to battle you will roll aunique six-sided dice let's have a lookthe star is used in conjunction withsome command cards otherwise it isconsidered a miss a grenade scores awound on any type of enemy unit theInfantry token will score a wound on anenemy infantry unit the tank will onlyscore a hit on an enemy tank unit theflag will cause an enemy toretreat the number of dice and attackinginfantry unit roles is simple three 21 so green will only roll one die andtry to wound the enemy infantryunit it's a success and the enemy unitremoves one infantry model let's have alook at the other units tanks can movethree hexas and still battle they have abattle range of also three hex's butthey will roll three dice so tanks asyou can imagine are quite nastyartillery is my favorite they can onlymove one hex and if they move they can'tbattle but well let's just say I reckonthey're the nastiest thing in the gamehere the town hexers would normallyblock line of sight for infantry andtanks to all enemy units in thecenter artillery though does not needline of sight and artillery has thelongest range so the number of diceartillery roll when battling is 3 3 2 2what's that folks you want more okayalso 1 one so let's have a look at thethings I didn't like about this game somuch well one it didn't have uh no okaytwo it no three it didn't really wellthere were no Faults as far as I cantell I think it makes for quite abalanced game so let's have a look atthe three little things that stood outto me as a big thumbs up everything hasa spot in the Box the game unpacks andpacks up very easily there is a rulesummary card for each type of terrainyou lay them alongside the board and youwon't have to refer to the rule book forterrain modifications to the game thehistorical background supplied for eachMission really helps players understandmore about what they're trying toachieve and why as you can see themechanics behind Memoir 44 are quitesimple upon reading the rule book thatis both well written and has greatexamples I was somewhat concerned themechanics were too simple and that thegame couldn't possibly offer strategicor tactical play at all the game Ithought must have a strong element ofluck and my assumption for this wasbased on the dice and card play involvedand whilst luck is certainly involved inthe mechanics in m44 I never felt nowgames that having luck on your sideplayed a part in actually winning a gameof M 44 I felt tactics did after myfirst play I was already seeing strategyin the game but I will say it's sort ofit's sort of a game where by the end ofyour opponent's next turn any strategyyou may have had going into the game umwell it may have already gone out thewindow by the end of his turn which isone of my my favorite things about thisgame believe it or not it seems toalways keep you on your toes and reallyfocus on every move your opponent makesand adjust your tactics as he plays outhis so if there was any player downtimeduring the game I never noticed as Ialways seem to be involved in it thereare plenty of tactical choices anddecisions to be made in Memoir 44 onyour turn uh based on your hand of cardsand the current layout of your troopsand his troops uh and surprisingly therealways seems to be a beneficialcombination of the two components you'renever just passing and drawing cardsuntil you get the one you want oranything like that now there are only 16missions provided with the base game 16missions sounds well a bit limiting butit really isn't no game goes exactly thesame and there are always two sides toeach historically correct story orMission provided so players afterplaying one round can swap sides to trytheir hand at Victory from anotherperspective uh replay value for me hasbeen no problem uh with this game as astandalone game the game gets playedvery often and I still enjoy every gameI play there are plenty of expansions totry uh some will add new terrain boardscenarios planes uh and there's somethat add more players so my forecast forfuture replay value is well I'llprobably run out of money long before Istop playing this game uh ontocomponents well it's days of Wonder I'dbe shocked if you open the box and weredisappointed at all uh all thecomponents in the game are excellentthere's about 140 odd Miniatures thedouble-sided board uh one side is afield and oneid of beach that's that wasa fantastic addition I thought the uhcommand cards are great however notplastic coated which I'm usually Iusually find coating a big bonus butbecause the game comes with card holdersthe cards aren't handled quite so muchand uh it probably wouldn't make much ofa difference if they were coded uhsleeving is an option I may look intolater though uh artwork seems to reallysuit the game perfectly each terrain hexis easily identifiable from the next umthe design of the double-sided board andthe hex terrain and how everything goestogether to create a really nice lookinggame is great it sort of makes the gameonce set up very appealing to playersand passes by and it adds greatly to thetheme I think if you're into wargamingand after a lighter game with plenty oftheme whether it be for a beer andpretzels wargaming night or perhaps toget younger ones involved in the hobbyso that you can benefit from theirbirthdays and Christmases I think menoir44 will be right up your alley in sayingthat I'm not trying to give you theimpression that this game is a beer andpretzels game or has little depth itactually is a lot deeper than I thoughtit would be um but for a war gamercoming into Memoir 44 expecting aheavier sort of war game board gamething you

Designed to commemorate the efforts and sacrifices of the men & women of the Second World War, we trust it will provide youwith a sense of history and the desire to learn more about that Greatest Generation of all. Our fondest hope is that you will also transmit that unique historical heritage onto younger generations. Days of Wonder, Inc. – May 2004 FROM THE AUTHOR Memoir '44 is a unique historical game that allows players to effectively portray stylized WWII battles. The battles, showcased in the scenario section, focus on important terrain features and the historical deploymentof forces in scale with the game system. By design, Memoir '44 is not overly complex. Its main focus is on theground forces of the Axis and Allied armies. The scale of the game fluctuates from battle to battle. For some scenarios, an infantry unit may represent an entire battalion, while in other scenarios a unit may represent a single company or platoon. But the tactics youneed to execute conform remarkably well to the advantages and limitations inherent to the various units, theirweapons and terrain. The game mechanics, although simple, will still require strategic card play, timely dice rolling and an aggressive, yet flexible battle plan to achieve victory. Welcome and Enjoy! Richard Borg33From the opening minutes of D-Day to the liberation of Paris and beyond - Memoir '44 airdrops you into the key battles that turnedthe tide in Western Europe. Omaha Beach… Pegasus Bridge… Sainte Mère-Église… and beyond… Take command of your troops andrewrite the pages of history in those decisive days of 1944! Components A recent intelligence sortie behind enemy lines recovered an unusual cardboard box. As per protocol, the contents were examined, itemized and entered into the logbook: ✪A double-sided Battlefield board map (beach landings and countryside) ✪2 Punchboards featuring: — 44 double-sided Terrain hex pieces — 10 double-sided Victory Medals — 14 Special Forces badges— 4 double-sided rectangular Bunker and Bridge tiles ✪2 Army bags of miniatures (Green Army: Allied Forces; Blue-Gray: Axis/German Forces), each containing: — 42 Infantry figures — 24 Armored vehicles — 6 Artillery pieces — 18 man-made Obstacles — 3 Cardholder sections ✪1 Deck of 70 cards, including: — 60 Command cards • 40 Section cards • 20 Tactic cards — 9 Summary cards • 7 Terrain cards • 1 double-sided Unit summary card • 1 double-sided Obstacle summary card ✪8 Battle dice ✪1 Rules and Scenario booklet ✪1 Days of Wonder Online access number located on the back of the Rules and Scenario booklet German US Rangers British AirborneFrench FFI Medal of HonorDouble sided Hex Iron Cross Bridges Bunkers Command cardsInfantry Artillery Armored vehicles GERMAN FORCES ALLIED FORCESBarbed wireHedgehogs Sand bags Section cards Tactic cards Terrain cards Units summary Obstacles summary Terrain summary Grenade Star Armor Infantry (x 2) Flag44Setting up the game You will greatly benefit by applying a small degree of discipline (Buck Up Soldier!) when setting up a game scenario in Memoir '44. We strongly recommend that you follow the step-by-step approach outlined below when setting up a game, especially for your first few plays. The reward is an endless variety of battlefields to play on, and theopportunity to pick-up fascinating historical tidbits and information from each of the scenarios played. 1 - Select a battle from the scenario section of this booklet. If this is your first game of Memoir ’44, we strongly suggest you start with the first battle - Pegasus Bridge, p 19. This battle was both the openingengagement of D-Day and is a good introductory scenario to Memoir ’44. 2 - Place the board in the center of the table, with the proper face (countryside or beach landing) visible. For Pegasus Bridge, this means the countryside face up. 3 - Place the necessary Terrain hexes, as indicated by the battle scenario. For Pegasus Bridge, lay the 20 River hexes, then 4 Village hexes and finally 9 Forest hexes. 4 - Add the fixed (Bunkers and Bridges) and removable Obstacles, if any. For Pegasus Bridge, this means two bridges, one over each river, and four barbed wires and asandbag placement to protect the bridge’s perimeter. 5 - Now place the figures on the board, matching the various units’ positions to the scenario’s battle map.Experience shows that dropping one figure per hex, for posi-tioning purposes, then filling up the units as required, is thequickest way to set up. An Artillery unit is usually made of 2 figures, an Armor unit - 3 and an Infantry unit - 4. 6 - Add the Special Unit badges to individual units and Victory Medals to specific, on-the-map objectives, ifrequired per the scenario’s special rules. For Pegasus Bridge, place an Allied victory medal on each bridge. 7 - Place the Terrain summary cards that correspond to the terrain in the scenario (Wood, Towns & Villages and Rivers summary cards for Pegasus Bridge) , plus the Obstacle and Units summary cards, to the board’s side, for in-game reference. If needed, refer to Terrain in Appendix 2 (p 13)for additional details on each terrain’s effects. 8 - Assemble the cardholder segments and place them on the board map’s edges. The card holders are not necessary, but are particularly useful when playing in teamsof multiple players to a side, or in a classroom/demonstration environment. With them, players on a same side can point to and study various options. 9 - Now choose each player’s side and sit in front of the board accordingly. Given the relatively short duration of a typical battle scenario, we recommend match play, with each player taking first one side, then the other in an immediate re-match.This helps balance any historical advantage that one side may have in a particular scenario. The winner of the match is theplayer who scores the most Victory Medals after both battles. 1 6+ 34Place Terrain hex. x20 x4 x912 10 8 75510 - Shuffle the Command cards deck thoroughly, and deal Command cards to each side per the selected scenario’s briefing notes. Place those cards in your respective cardholder, keeping them secret from the opposing player. For Pegasus Bridge, the Allied Commander-in-Chief receives 6 Command cards, while the German General starts with a meager 2! Rommelshouldn’t have been vacationing on that fateful day! 11 - Place the remainder of the deck face down, alongside the board’s battlefield, within easy reach of both players. 12 - Each side takes four Battle dice. 13 - The starting player (in Pegasus Bridge — British Major, John Howard) , as indicated in the scenario’s briefing notes, begins play. Battlefield Battles are fought over a hexagonalgame board 13 hexes wide by 9hexes deep. The battlefield isdivided into three sections by twored dotted lines, giving each playera left flank, a center and a rightflank section. Where a dotted linecuts through a hex, the hex is con-sidered to be a part of both theflank and center section. Command Cards Army units may only move and/or battle when given anorder. Command cards are used to order your troops tomove, battle and/or execute a special command. There aretwo types of command cards: Section cards and Tactic cards . Section cards Section cards are used to order a move and/or battle in a specific section. These cards indicate in which sec- tion(s) of the battlefield you may order units and how many units you may order. Tactic cards Tactic cards allow you to make special moves, battle in a specific way or take special actions, as explained on the card. Some cards allow you to order troops in just one section, while others order units in all sections.2 546 Place UnitsCommand card deck x4 x1 x24 x3611 12 10 Section cards Tactics cards COUNTRY SIDE BEACH SIDE66Object of the Game The object of the game is to be the first to win a set number of Victory Medals (usually 4 to 6, depending on the selected battle scenario’s victory conditions). In Memoir ’44, a Victory Medal is gained for each enemy unit entirely eliminated from the battlefield. Each Medal won is designated by placing the last figure of the eliminated unit on any of the available Medal Stands located on your bottom leftedge of the board. In some scenarios, additional Medals may be gained from the board map itself, for capturing and holding certain terrain hexes or battlefield objectives. Game Turn The player listed in the briefing notes goes first. Players then alternate taking turns, until one of the players reaches thenumber of Victory Medals indicated in the scenario’s victory conditions. 1 - Play a Command Card At the start of your turn, play one Command card from your hand. Place it face up in front of you, and read it aloud. Command cards are normally used to order units to move and/or battle. The card you play will indicate in which section(s) of the battlefield you may issue orders, and how manyunits you may order. 2 - Order Units After playing a command card, announce which corresponding unit(s) you chooseto order. Only those units that are issued an order may move, battle, or take a special action, later in the turn. Units on a hex with a red dotted line running through it may be ordered from either section.On your turn, follow the sequence below: 1 - Play a Command card. 2 - ORDER . Announce all units you intend to order, within the limits of the Section or Tactical Command card just played. 3 - MOVE . Move all ordered units you wish, one at a time. Respect unit and terrain movement limitations, as per the summary cards. 4 - BATTLE . Battle one ordered unit at a time. Select an enemy target and a.Check Battle Range (by counting down the Battle dice, see page 9), and Line of Sight (page 9) b.Check for potential Terrain effects (page 13). c.Resolve Battle (page 10) 5 - Draw a new Command card. Or77You may not give more than one order to each unit. If the Command card allows you to issue more orders in a given section of the battlefield than you have units in that section, those additional orders are lost. 3 - Move Units Movements are announced and made sequentially, one ordered unit at a time, in the sequence of your choice. A unit mayonly move once per turn. A unit that is ordered does nothave to move. You must complete one unit’s movement before beginning another. In addition, you must complete all unit movements before proceeding to Battle (step 4). Ordered units may move from one section of the battlefield into another. Two units may not occupy the same hex. When moving a unit, you may not move onto or through a hex occupied by a friendly or enemy unit. You may not split off individual figures from a unit; they must stay together and always move as a group. Units that are reduced through casualties may not combine with other units. Some terrain features affect movement and may prevent a unit from moving its full distance or battle (see Terrain section on page 13). Retreat movement rules vary slightly from regular movement (see section on Retreat page 10). • Infantry Movement An ordered Infantry unit may move up to 1 hex and battle or2 hexes and not battle. Starting PositionExample: To move the infantry unit to its destination to the village's right, you must first move the unit ahead of it out of t he way. This is forbidden First, move the right unit, 1 hex to the right……then move the other unit. The armor unit must move 3 hexes, around the infantry, to reach its destination Move 1 and battle Move 2 and no battle Splitting is forbiddenRegrouping is forbidden or88Special Forces Infantry units ordered may move up to 2 hexes and still battle! • Armor Movement An ordered Armor unit may move up to 3 hexes and battle. • Artillery Movement An ordered Artillery unit may move 1 hex or battle. 4 - Battle Battles are checked and resolved sequentially, one ordered unit at a time, in the sequence of your choice. You must announce and resolve one unit’s battle entirely before beginning the next one. A unit may only battle once per turn. A unit that is ordered does not have to battle. A unit may not split its Battle dice between several enemy targets.The number of casualties a unit has suffered does not affect the number of Battle dice it will roll in combat. A unit with a single figure left retains the same firepower as a unit at full strength. A unit attacking an adjacent enemy unit is said to be in \"Close Assault\" with that enemy. A unit attacking an enemy unit more than 1 hex away is said to \"Fire\" at that enemy. A unit adjacent to an enemy unit must Close Assault this unit if it chooses to battle. It may not fire on another, more distant, enemy unit instead. Special Forces move 2 and battle! Armor units move up to 3 and battle Artillery guns either move… …or battle. or CLOSE ASSAULT: attack an adjacent hex FIRE: attack from a distance Combat Procedure To battle: 1 - Announce the ordered unit you want to attack with, and its target. a.Check Battle Range: verify that your target is within battle range or contact; b.Check Line of Sight (Infantry and Armor only): verify that your target is within line of sight. 2 - Count down the number of Battle dice to roll, based on the type of unit you’re attacking with and its distance to target. 3 - Determine terrain Battle dice reduction, if any. Reduce the number of Battle dice rolled accordingly. 4 - Resolve Battle: Roll Battle dice and resolve resulting dice rolls.99• Battle Range - Infantry An ordered Infantry unit may battle any enemy target unit 3 or fewer hexes away. It rolls 3 dice in close assault (enemy on adjacent hex), 2 dice against a target at 2hexes, and 1 die against a target at 3 hexes. To determine the number of Battle dice to roll, simply “count down” the number of dice rolled: Position your finger on the firsthex adjacent to your unit and move it, one hex at a time, in thedirection of the target, counting down (“3”, “2”, “1”) as youreach new hexes. The last number you pronounce when your fin-ger reaches the target is the number of dice you should roll. • Battle Range - Armor An ordered Armor unit may battle any enemy target unit 3 or fewer hexes away. It always combats at 3 dice. • Battle Range - Artillery An ordered Artillery unit may battle any enemy targetunit 6 or fewer hexes away. It combats at 3,3,2,2,1,1 asillustrated on the right. • Line of Sight To battle, an Infantry or Armor unit must be able to \"see\" the enemy unit it wants to target. This is known as having \"line of sight\". An Artillery unit doesnot require line of sight to target an enemy unit. Imagine a line drawn from the center of the hex containing the battling unit to the center of the hex containing the enemy target. The line of sight is consid-ered blocked if any hex (or part of a hex) intercepting this imaginary line seg-ment contains an obstruction. Obstructions include units (friends or foes) orcertain type of terrain features. The terrain in the target hex does not block line of sight. When the imaginary line runs along the edge of one or several hexes which containobstructions, the line of sight is notblocked, unless the obstructions standsomewhere along both sides of the linesegment. Enemy at 2 hexes Allies unit has line of sight Line of sight is blocked on both sides Line of sight is blocked on both sides Enemy out of range Range and number of dice rolled by infantry, based on distance to target. Infantry is said to \"combat at 3, 2, 1\" Range and number of dice rolled by armor Range and number of dice rolled by artillery Line of sight from the left unit to the enemy is blocked by the center unit The Allies unit has line of sight to the unit in the woods' border, but not to the other unit hiding behind the woods.1010• Terrain Reductions Each type of terrain and obstacle is described in the Terrain and Obstacles section (Appendix 2, p 13). Please refer to that section or the corresponding summary cards, and deduct any potential terrain Battle dice reduction from the number of diceto be rolled in the attack. • Resolve Battle Hits are resolved first, followed by retreats. Hit In battle, the attacker scores 1 hit for each dice symbol rolled thatmatches the unit type targeted. Each Grenade rolled is also 1 hit. For each hit scored, 1 figure is removed from the target unit. When the last piece in the opponent's unit is removed, place it on top of one ofthe empty Medal Stands on your side of the battlefield. If an attacking player rolls more hits than the number of figures in the defending unit, these additional hits have no effect. Miss Retreat The player controlling the unit decides which hex his unit retreats onto using the following rules: ◆A unit must always retreat toward its controlling player’s side of the board. ◆Terrain has no effect on retreat moves, therefore a retreating unit may move through a forest or village without stopping. However, impassable terrain may not be moved through during a retreat move. ◆A unit may not retreat onto, or through, a hex already containing another unit (regardless if friend or foe). ◆If a unit cannot retreat; is forced to retreat off the limits of the battlefield; or would be pushed back onto a sea hex, one figure must be removed from the unit for each retreat move that cannot be completed. ◆Some obstacles will allow certain units to ignore the first flag rolled against them. Score 1 hit on Infantry Score 1 hit on Armor Score 1 hit on any type: Infantry, Armor or Artillery HIT MISSIf the attacker fails to roll any of the symbols needed to hit the enemy target or to force the enemy to retreat, this is a miss. The Star side of the Battle die is used in a limited number of Tactical Command Cards, otherwise it is a miss. RetreatAfter all hits have been resolved and casualties removed, retreats are resolved. For each Flag rolled on the target unit, the unit must move one hex back toward its own side of the battlefield. Two flags push the unit back two hexes, etc. Allied unit rolls a Flag, an Infantry and a Star. After taking 1 casualty, the Axis unit has 2 possible retreats: or1111• Taking Ground When an ordered Infantry unit in Close Assault combat eliminates the enemy unit or forces it to retreat, it mayTake Ground by advancing into the vacated hex. An Artillery unit may not take ground. Terrain movement and battle restrictions still apply when units take ground. When an ordered Armor unit in Close Assault combat eliminates the enemy unit or forces it to retreat, it may take the ground by advancing into the vacatedhex and claim an Armor Overrun combat. • Armor Overrun Combat On a successful Close Assault Combat, an ordered Armor unit may move into the vacated hex and may then battle again. If the ground you take during theOverrun puts you adjacent to an enemy unit, this second battle must onceagain be a Close Assault Combat. Otherwise, you may fire at a distant unit. ◆A unit may Take Ground again after a successful Overrun Combat. ◆However, an Armor unit may only make one Overrun Combat during a turn. ◆All Battles, Close Assault and Overrun Combats must be completed before the next unit may battle. 5 - Draw a Command card After resolving all hits and retreats, discard the Command card played and draw another card from the deck. Your turn is now ov er. If the draw deck runs out of cards, the discards are shuffled to form a new draw deck. Here, another Axis unit is in the way - there is only one retreat path left: Allied Infantry rolls a Flag and an Infantry symbol on a Close Assault The Allied player chooses to \"Take Ground\" immediately, to take advantage of the forest’s cover.After taking one casualty, the Axis unit retreats Allied Armor rolls a Flag and an Infantry symbol on a Close Assault The Allied player chooses to \"Overrun\" immediately After moving in, the Armor unit can now battle again!After taking one casualty, the Axis unit retreats An Axis unit and a river block both retreat options – the Axis unit cannot move and takes one additional casualty as a result : 1 2 3 41212Appendix 1 - SPECIAL UNITS Using the Special Units summary card On the back of the Standard Units summary card is a list of the various types of Special Forces and other Elite units that may be encountered in Memoir ’44. Rounded corners at the top of a unit’s symbol are used to denote a Special Forces or Elite unit on the map. A number in the lower right corner of a unit’s symbol is used to indicate the number of figures per unit, when it differs from the standard number. Special Forces and Elite units behave in the same way as the corresponding (Infantry or Armor) standard unit in all respects except as described below and on the summary card. Using the Special Forces Badges In scenarios combining Standard and Special Units relying on the same figures (Commandos mixed withInfantry on the edges of Sword Beach, for example), use the corresponding Special Forces badges, putting one into each hex occupied by the Special Unit, to distinguish it from regular troops. French Resistance benefited from a superior knowledge of the countryside and increasing support of the population as the war went on. As such, French Resistance forces: ◆May always battle when they penetrate a new terrain type (Woods, Villages, Hedgerows) where standard Infantry would stop and not battle. ◆May disappear in the countryside, retreating up to 3 hexes instead of the standard 1 on any retreat flag rolled. ◆Their limited number means they always start with 3 figures per unit, in lieu of the standard 4. ◆Unlike other Special Forces, French Resistance units that opt to move 2 hexes may not battle on the same turn. Special Forces (including US Rangers, British Commandos and other Elite units): Special Forces Special Forces and Elite units symbols and powers Axis \"Kommandos\" British special troops Rangers unit \"LA RÉSISTANCE\" is the generic term used to describe the various movements (armed or not) that fought the Axis forces in occupied France following the surrender of 1940. General De Gaulle's widelyheard broadcast of June 18th, 1940 on BBC galvanized patriots of all political and geographic origins.Increasingly larger, well organized and better equipped groups sprang into action over the followingyears, providing an effective \"Shadow\" army in the days leading to D-Day. In close contact with the Allies, who often air-dropped them arms and money, the Resistants sabotaged supply lines, sheltered Specialforces operating behind the enemy lines, and assassinated prominent figures of the German-backed regime.From 1944 on, the military groups within the Resistance became known as the FFI (“Forces Francaises del’Intérieur” – French Forces of the Interior). The intelligence they offered during the preparatory stages ofOperation Overlord paved the way for the successful Allied landings. The Rangers shoulder patch of the units who attackedthe Pointe-du-Hoc The \"Pegasus\" shoulder patch of the British 6thAirborne Division whotook \"Pegasus Bridge\" Axis attacked Resistants who were hiding in the woods, and rolled 2 flags. Resistants choose to retreat and take cover in the village that is as far as 4 hexes away The patch of the German \"Grossdeutschland\" elite forces1313Special Forces historically acquired superior mobility and firepower thanks to their ruthlesstraining and non-standard armament: - Unlike regular Infantry, Special Forces may move 2 hexes and still battle (instead of being forced tochoose between moving 1 hex and battling, ormoving 2 hexes and not battling). They remainsubject to usual terrain limitations however. Elite Armor Elite Armor units, such as the German divisions outfitted with Tiger tanks, were a devastating enemy on thebattlefield. - Unlike regular Armor units, Elite Armor units start with 4 tank figures per unit, denoting their exceptional resistance to all but a well-aimed shot from the back. Appendix 2 - TERRAIN Using the Terrain Help Cards The Terrain Help cards provide a short summary of the key effects of each terrain type.When you set up your scenario, display the Help Cards that correspond to the terraintypes used in the scenario on the side of the board. — The Effect section describes the various features of the terrain.— The soldier and the tank icons indicate the defensive capabilities of the terrain. In this example, attacking infantry units roll 1 less die, and attacking armor units roll 2 less dice. Forests ◆Movement: A unit that enters a Forest hex must stop and may move no further on that turn. ◆Battle: A unit may not battle the turn it moves onto a Forest hex. ◆When battling an enemy unit that is on a Forest hex, Infantry reduce the number of Battle dice rolled by 1, Armor reduce the number of Battle dice rolled by 2 and Artillery Battle dice are notreduced.◆Line of Sight: A Forest blocks line of sight. Effect section defensive capabilities of the terrain …but they are still subject to terrain constraints: here, they stop and do not battle because of the woods hex. Elite Armor have 4 tank figures Special Forces move 2 and battle! Turn #1: Allied player moves into the woods: the unit must stop and cannot battle this turn Turn #2: Axis player moves closer and battles, but rolling 2 dice instead of 3, because the Allied Infantry is protected by the woods. Turn #3: Time for revenge! The Allied player can now battle, with 3 dice.1414Hedgerows Hedgerows are a landscape typical of Normandy: small grass fields separated by tall rows of shrubs, tree lines or fences. This proved to be very difficult terrain for the Allies as they wouldnever know what danger lay hidden behind the next hedgerow. ◆Movement: To move onto a Hedgerow hex, a unit must be adjacent to the Hedgerow. A unit that enters a Hedgerow muststop and may move no further on that turn. A unit that leaves a Hedgerow hex may only move onto an adjacent hex. ◆Battle: A unit may not battle the turn it moves onto a Hedgerow hex. ◆When battling an enemy unit that is on a Hedgerow hex, Infantry reduce the number of Battle dice rolled by 1, Armor reduce the number of Battle dice rolled by 2 andartillery Battle dice are not reduced.◆Line of Sight: A Hedgerow blocks line of sight. Hills ◆Movement: No movement restrictions.◆Battle: When battling an enemy unit that is up a Hill, Infantry andArmor reduce the number of Battledice rolled by 1 and Artillery Battledice are not reduced. When battling an enemy unit at the same height as your unit, there is no Battle dice reduction.◆Line of Sight: A Hill blocks line of sight for units trying to look over the Hill. Line of sight is not blocked when units are at the same height and on the same Hill (plateau effect). Towns & Villages ◆Movement: A unit that enters a Town hex must stop and may move no further on that turn.◆Battle: A unit may not battle the turn it moves onto a Town hex. ◆When battling an enemy unit that is on a Town hex, infantry reduce the number of Battle dice rolled by 1, Armor reduce thenumber of Battle dice rolled by 2 and Artillery Battle dice are not reduced. Armor on a Town hex will reduce the number of Battle dice it rolls by 2.◆Line of Sight: A Town blocks line of sight. Turn #1: move and stop next to the Hedgerow hexTurn #2: you may now enter the Hedgerow hex Turn #1: move and stop next to the Hedgerow hexTurn #2: you may now move normally Allies attack from a lower elevation, rolling 2 dice instead of 3 But if they are on a hill too, they roll 3 dice Allies can battle because they are on the same height Other town and village hexes:1515Rivers & Waterways ◆Movement: A River is impassable terrain. A unit may only enter a River hex when the hex has a bridge.◆Battle: A unit on a River hex with a bridge battles as normal.◆Line of Sight: A River does not block line of sight. Oceans ◆Movement: A unit that moves onto an Ocean hex may move a maximum of 1 hex. Units are assumed to be onlanding craft or in shallow waters until they move ontoa Beach hex. An Ocean hex is impassable terrain forretreat moves.◆Battle: A unit on an Ocean hex may not battle. ◆Line of Sight: An Ocean does not block line of sight. Beaches ◆Movement: A unit that moves onto a Beach hex may only move 2 hexes.◆Battle: No combat restrictions. A unit may still Take Ground after a successful Close Assault Combat.◆Line of Sight: A Beach does not block line of sight. Amphibious \"DD\" Sherman tank unit moves only one hex while in water On the next turn, it drops its flotation device, and moves 2 hexes onto the sand Axis Infantry rolled an Infantry and a Flag symbol The Allies unit cannot retreat, and so takes 2 casualties instead of 1 The Armor unit must take the bridge to cross the River The Infantry unit can fire over the RiverFIXED OBSTACLES When an obstacle is on a Terrain hex, the Battle dice reductions of the two are not cumulative. The best protection is the only one that matters. For example, a bunker on a hill reduces the number of dice rolled by a tank attacking from a lower elevationby 2, not 2+1 (bunker protection is 2, hill is 1). Another example: a sandbag on a village does not add anything to the villag e protection (village defense is 2/1, sandbag defense is 1), though it does provide an additional feature: any unit in the villag e may ignore the first flag rolled against it, due to the sandbags. Bunkers ◆Movement: An Infantry unit may battle the turn it moves onto a Bunker hex. An Armor or Artillery unit may not move onto a Bunker hex. Artillery units that start on a Bunker hex may not move from the hex. ◆Battle: Only the side noted in the briefing notes may claim a Bunker as a defensive position. ◆When battling an enemy unit that is on a Bunker hex, Infantry reduce the number of Battle dice rolled by 1, Armor reduce the number of Battle dice rolled by 2 and Artillery Battle dice are not reduced. ◆Remove one Artillery figure for each retreat Flag rolled against an artillery unit in a bunker. ◆ A unit in a bunker may ignore the first flag rolled against it. ◆Line of Sight: A Bunker blocks line of sight. Hedgehogs Hedgehogs were obstacles against tanks and landing craft. They were usually made of steel rails assembled together. They could also be made of wood, with an anti-tank mine at theirtop. Unexpectedly, the Allied infantry troops used them for cover while moving on beaches. ◆Movement: Only Infantry units may enter a Hedgehog hex. No movement restrictions. ◆Battle: No combat restrictions. A unit on a Hedgehog hex may ignore the first Flag rolled against it. ◆Line of Sight: A Hedgehog does not block line of sight. REMOVABLE OBSTACLES Sandbags ◆Movement: No movement restrictions. When a unit leaves a hex with Sandbags, the Sandbags are removed. ◆Battle: A unit in a hex with Sandbags is protected on all sides, not just along the hex-sides where the Sandbags are placed. When a unit does not benefit from any protection for its terrain, the sand-bags reduce the number of Battle dice rolled by 1 when attacked by Infantry or Armor. As usual, Artillery Battle dice are not reduced. ◆ A unit hidden behind sandbags may ignore the first flag rolled against it. ◆Line of Sight: A Sandbagged hex does not block line of sight. Wire ◆Movement: A unit that enters a hex with Wire must stop and may move no further on that turn. ◆Battle: An Infantry unit that is on a hex with Wire, will reduce the number of Battle dice it rolls by 1. An Infantry unit that is eligible to battle may remove the Wire instead of battling. Armor must removethe Wire and may still battle.◆Line of Sight: Wire does not block line of sight. 1616Appendix 3 - MULTI-PLAYER GAMES, VARIANTS & ADDITIONAL SCENARIOS Team Play The simplest way to play with up to six players is to try Memoir ’44 in team play! Make two teams of up to 3 players a side (if you have an odd number of players, simply put one more player on one side than on the other). Each team places their Command cards on a card holder, pointing out and evaluating possible strategies internally before jointly agreeing on the card to play. The member of the team most directly concerned by the card being played then carries outthe relevant actions, moving units, selecting targets and rolling Battle dice where appropriate. ◆In 2-player teams, one player is in charge of the center of the battlefield and acts as Commander-in-Chief, while the second player directs the two flanks. ◆In 3-player teams, each player is assigned its own individual section. The player in the Center is also Commander-in-Chief. The Commander-in-Chief is responsible for playing Tactic cards that apply to no particular (or all) sections of the battlefield . Memoir ‘44 Overlord – battles on a grand scale! Experienced players will want to combine multiple copies of Memoir '44 to play scenarios over large, multi-board battlefields in a new kind of meta-game, known as Memoir ’44 Overlord! Overlord scenarios are unique in that two (and in some instances three!) boards are combined into one single, oversized battlefield, allowing up to eight players (four to a side) to replay his - torical WWII battles on a grand scale. With Memoir '44 Overlord , players can experience the frustrations associated with being part of a military style WWII chain of command and at the same time, enjoy the challenges of coordination and cooperation needed to gain the victory. The bat-tle scenarios and maps are stylized, but thanks to the larger scale, they focus with additional detail on major and minor ter-rain features that existed on the original battlefield, and fine tune the historical deployment of the Axis and Allied forces. A special bonus scenario is provided on the last page of the battle section of this booklet called Omaha Beach - Overlord Version . This bonus scenario requires the supplemental \"Memoir ’44 Overlord – rules booklet\" which can be downloaded free from our web site at: www.memoir44.com Variant for Young Generals If needed, young children can play a simplified version of the game and still have a lot of fun with it. Young children often count better than they read, so we suggest the following modifications: ◆Remove all Tactic cards from the deck – just keep the Section cards ◆If needed, you can choose not to play the Take Ground and the Armor Overrun rules ◆Every time the deck is exhausted, remember to shuffle the Section cards before making a new deck It is easier if an adult introduces the children to the game, and plays a couple of games with them. It is also a good opportun ity for a parent or a teacher to use the game as an introduction to the Allied involvement during WWII and draw their interest intothe battles that shaped our modern history. Additional Scenarios Memoir ’44 is a game of endless possibilities. The various offensives and counter-attacks, critical battles and lesser-knownskirmishes, plus the numerous other theaters of operations on which WWII was fought provide a fertile ground. In collaboration with Memoir '44 author, Richard Borg, Days of Wonder will continue to update the game through the regular release of new campaigns and scenarios, additional rules, materials and miniatures, etc… For a first taste of things to come and additional hours of enjoyment visit us and make sure to register at: www.memoir44.com 1717\n","\n","\n","\n","----------referencias_principiantes------\n","Days of Wonder, the Days of Wonder logo, Memoir ’44, the Memoir ’44 logotype and all related product and brand names are registered trademarks or trademarks of Days of Wonder, Inc. and copyrights © 2002 -2007 Days of Wonder, Inc. MEMOIR ’44 – A BEGINNER’S REFEREN CE INTRO This guide is targeted to Memoir ’44 beginners and is meant to help them better interpret some of the rules of the game. It is NOT meant to replace any of the following MUST READ documents : - the rulebook : (http://static.memoir44.com/lang/english/images/mm_rules_part1_en.pdf ) - the official FAQs: (http://www.days ofwonder.com/memoir44/en/content/faq/ ) - the unofficial FAQ available at BGG: (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/file/download/35704/M44_Unofficial_FAQ_v12.pdf ) The unoff icial FAQ is 90% similar to the official one, but better structured and easier to search for information. This document will not help more experienced players and also does not discuss (at least for now) any of the expansions, since the main target is the new player, having only the base game and needing a jumpstart or some reference. DOCUMENT REVISION S Version 0.1 released for comments. It c ontains only 11 TACTIC CARDS explained. Version 0.2 released for comments. It contains all 15 Tactic cards from th e base game and a scenario setup. Version 0.3 released for comments. It contains all 15 Tactic cards as well as a 5 turn game explained step by step. TACTIC CARDS Most of the “special” (or Tactic) cards from Memoir are pretty clear, but there are some whic h are a little bit harder to grasp, and I realised that beginners tend to get these wrong sometimes (I hope I got them right:) . Also, the FAQs are great in discussing some important cases and how they should be treated so I will not go over the same topics unless I feel they are pretty important and are worth duplicating here. All cards that specify a number of units to be ordered also allow you to order “0” units which means you just pass the turn, discard the card and draw another one. This number is NOT mandatory; it represents just the maximum number of units that can be ordered.Page | 2 1. ARMOR ASSAULT When played, this card allows the player to issue an order to 0 -4 ARMOR units he has on the board, no matter the section. Ordering the units is the same as with a normal command card (first pick all the units to order, then move them all if needed or possible , then battle if needed or possible). The card adds a bonus to those 4 ARMOR units: if they will battle in Close Assault, they will roll 1 additional die ( e.g. we have an armor unit 3 hexes away from an infantry unit; it can battle without moving with the normal 3 dice, or move 2 hexes near the targeted infantry unit and roll an additional die becaus e now it is in Close Assault and it can benefit from the bonus ). Terrain movement and battle restrictions still apply ( e.g. if attacking an infantry in a town from 2 or 3 hexes away, roll 3 -2=1 die per the normal rules; if attacking an infantry in a town in Close Assault, roll 3 -2+1=2 dice, using the bonus ). If the player has NO Armor units on the board, it can order 1 other unit of his choice (e.g. infantry or artillery). The additional die will also be used if making an Armor Overrun in a Close Assault position.Page | 3 2. COUNTER -ATTACK This card practically duplicates any card that your opponent just played. If he played for example Pincer Move (“order 2 units on the Left and 2 units on the Right sections ”) you can use Counter -Attack just like if you had in hand a Pincer Move command card. Counter -Attack when played always borrows the effects of the last card played by the enemy. The sections will be preserved (if your enemy plays “Attack” with 3 units on his left , when counter -attacking you will also play “Attack” with 3 units BUT in the same section, which is on your right ). Apart from this section change, the effects are duplicated entirely. A player can also play Counter -Attack to a Counter -Attack card (e.g.: player A plays “Probe” with 2 units on his left, you play Counter -Attack which will let you order 2 units on your right – the same section as your opponent – and now if he wants to order 2 units on the same section but does not have any “normal” command card for this, he can play a Counter -Attack w hich will borrow the effects of your Counter -Attack – which also borrowed the effects from the original Probe card – and he will be able to order 2 units on that very disputed section :) You cannot play this card during your opponent’s turn like the Ambush card.Page | 4 3. DIRECT FROM HQ This card is self explanatory: choose 0 to 4 units of ANY TYPE and order them per the normal rules (examples: you can order 2 infantry + 1 armor unit + 1 artillery OR 2 armor units OR any combination of maximum 4 units of any type)Page | 5 4. INFANTRY ASSAULT The player can order ALL infantry units (no matter how many) but in only 1 section. The se units benefit from the card’s bonus: they are able to move up to 2 hexes and still battle (in contrast with the normal action of moving only 1 hex and still battle) OR move 3 hexes but not battle (in contrast with the normal action of moving 2 hexes and not battle). This rule simply adds a hex for the movement of normal units. For Elite units, the difference is smaller: they can ALREADY mov e 2 hexes and battle without this card, so the card will only improve their abilities if they want to move 3 hexes and of course not battle, which they normally would not be able to do. Terrain movement and battle restrictions still apply ( e.g. if entering a forest after a 1 hex move, a normal infantry unit must still stop and cannot battle – per the forest restrictions - even if this card would allow it to continue the move and/or attack ). Like many Tactic cards, this one also allows you to order 1 unit of any type you have available, in case you have NO infantry unit s on the board.Page | 6 5. MOVE OUT! Choose 0 -4 infantry units from anywhere on the board and issue them orders. There is no special bonus and the terrain movement and battle restrictions still app ly. If there is no infantry unit available anywhere on the board, order 1 unit of any other type.Page | 7 6. AMBUSH This card is a special one: it is the only one that can be played DURING the opponent’s turn. That’ s right: if your opponent orders a unit ( e.g. moves an infantry unit of his near one of your armor units ), and then he declares Close Assault on one of your units, you can play this card in this very moment , before he gets to roll the dice. Immediately after playing it , he loses the chance to att ack and you get to roll dice first (according to your attacked unit rules, just like if you had attacked his unit first). There are 3 possibilities depending on the result of your attack: - You do not eliminate his unit nor make it retreat : in this case afte r your attack, he gets to attack you back. This happens even if you eliminate PART of his unit, but not all and also his unit maintained position. - You roll some flags and the enemy has to retreat : in this case he loses the chance to attack you and the turn is over for his unit (he will continue with other ordered unit or end turn) - You eliminate the enemy unit : of course the enemy has no unit now to attack you with and the Ambush was succesful! The opponent can continue his turn until completion with the re st of his ordered units. After playing this card, you should replentish your stock of cards by drawing another card (before your opponent does, at the end of his turn). You can “ambush” only one attack per card played (e.g. if on the opponent’s turn he mov es 3 units and it is clear that he will declare close assault on all 3 cases being near some of your units, you cannot play an ambush card for all your units, but only one, at your choice ; the Ambush card will still be played immediately after the enemy declares a close attack on the unit you chose to protect but before he gets to roll the dice). You cannot play Ambush and order another unit of yours: the ordered unit MUST be the one that the enemy intended to attack in close assault.Page | 8 7. ARTILLERY BOMBARD This card allows you to order ALL your artillery units (you are not forced to order them all if you don’t want/need to). These artillery units that are ordered with this card may EITHER move up to 3 hexes (normal movement restrictions apply ) OR battle tw ice ( e.g. you can attack twice the same target or carry out 2 attacks on different targets ). If you have NO artillery unit on board, issue an order to any unit you have available.Page | 9 8. BARRAGE Many beginners misinterpret this card. It actually gives a pla yer a “bonus attack”. The attacking unit is “outside” the board, there is no unit on the board that will actually attack , there is only the attacked enemy unit on the board . Once this card is played, the player chooses ANY enemy unit (it can be a normal i nfantry unit or an elite one, an armor unit, an artillery unit and so on). He does not have to have line of sight or be in the attacking distance (remember, there is no attacking unit on board, how could we calculate line of sight or distance then ?) . The player doesn’t even need to have an artillery unit, he can play this card even if he has only 1 soldier left and the targeted unit is on the other side of the board :). Once an enemy unit is targeted, the player rolls 4 dice, IGNORING any terrain reducti on (e.g. even if the targeted unit is an artillery unit in a bunker on a hill, the player still rolls 4 dice). The player scores 1 hit for each unit symbol or grenade (as in the normal rules) but unlike the normal rules, the flags cannot be ignored !! (the unit HAS TO retreat even if it would normally be protected from flags by bunkers, sandbags and so on). Of course, if for example we have an artillery unit in a bunker (as you know, this special combination does not allow the artillery to retreat) and the player rolls 2 flags, the flags will not be ignored and the unit will be lost (for every flag that must be executed on an artillery unit in a bunker, an artillery figure will be lost, since it is not allowed to retreat).Page | 10 9. BEHIND ENEMY LINES First of a ll the card is wrong (I understand it has been revised and reprinted). The correct description: “[…] Terrain movement and battle restrictions still apply […]” This card allows you to send a unit in the middle of the enemy’s territory (“behind enemy lines”), attack and then come back. The player chooses 1 infantry unit (no matter the section) and this unit will be allowed to: - Move up to 3 hexes (0 -3 hexes) ignoring terrain movement restrictions ( e.g. it can pass through 3 towns without stopping just as if there was no hex in its way )! - Attack an enemy unit (using 1 additional die as a bonus but applying any present battle reductions ) - Move again up to 3 hexes (0 -3 hexes) ignoring terrain movement restrictions. Some notes: - Any of the 3 actions above can be skipped (they are not mandatory; e.g. you can only attack without moving, or attack and then move, or just move 6 hexes (3+3 with no attack), etc .). - The unit cannot pass unpassable terrain (rivers are still blocking movement for all troops). - There is no requirement to move towards enemy territory; for example you can use this card to order an infantry unit with only 1 soldier figure to “return home” from enemy territory by ordering it to move 6 hexes towards your side (it can also attack somebody on i ts way back, after the first 3 hexes). - A unit cannot move 2 hex es, attack, and then move 4 hex es for a total of 6. A 6 hex move can be obtained only with a 3+3 hex move (or, in special cases, if the attack carried out between moves is followed by a “Take Ground” action, one additional hex is gained).Page | 11 10. CLOSE ASSAULT This card is best played when many of the player’s units (infantry or armor, not artille ry) are adjacent to enemy units because this card lets you order ALL these units . There is no movement allowed before or after playing this card (Taking Ground and Armor Overrun are permitted). Ordered units get to roll 1 additional die (the rule applies only to initial attack of a unit, not also in the Armor Overrun phase). There i s no limit on how many troops you can order: as long as an infantry or armor unit is already adjacent with an enemy unit at the start of the turn and does not need to move to become adjacent, it can attack with that additional die. The units that are not a djacent to enemy units will be ignored this turn.Page | 12 11. DIG -IN This card has many issues already clarif ied in the FAQ so I will not repeat them here. Basically the card allows a player to choose 4 infantry units from all over the board and improve their pro tection by placing sandbags on the units’ hexes. The units are not allowed to move and/or attack during this turn, they just work hard to protect themselves by building the sandbags. If the player has no infantry unit available, he may issue a normal orde r to 1 other unit of his choice (move/battle).Page | 13 12. FIREFIGHT When a player plays this card, he can choose 0 -4 of his units (no matter the type) and order them. These units: - Cannot be adjacent to ANY enemy unit - May not move during this turn (they can only fire/battle if there are enemy units in range) Each of these 4 units will roll 1 additional die when attacking. Terrain and battle restrictions still apply (first the number of dice to be rolled is calculated, per the normal rules then 1 die is added to th e result ). Of course, if an enemy infantry is 4 hexes away from our infantry unit – out of range - we cannot attack it, thinking that “we normally have 0 dice to roll and we add 1 which means we will attack with 1 die”. The attacked enemy unit MUST be in r ange first of all.Page | 14 13. MEDICS AND MECHANICS This card gives the player a chance to recover some or all of the figures of an incomplete unit (a unit that suffered casualties). First the player chooses one of his units to be recovered or repaired (any type is accepted). Then he rolls 1 die for each command card he has in hand including this card ( e.g. the current scenario specifies that the player has 6 cards, so he will roll 6 dice). The rest is explained pretty well on the card: for each unit symbol 1 lost figure of that unit is returned to duty. Star also counts in this case as a “recovery point”. A unit MAY NOT gain more figures than it originally had ( e.g. infantry will only have a maximum of 2 figures, normal armor units 3 figures, etc ). The good part: if after rolling this dice the player recovers at least 1 figure for that unit, the unit can also be issued an order (like any normal order: move and/or attack). Grenades and flags are ignored. An artillery figure can be repaired (re covered) only by roll ing a star (there is no “artillery” sign on the dice). Example play : we have in the heart of the enemy territory a poor infantry unit that suffered many casualties, it is down to 1 soldier figure and is a sure medal for the enemy. We can choose to help thi s unit by playing this card. After playing it, we specify to the other player the unit we will recover (our infantry unit) and if the current scenario specifies we should have 4 cards in hand, we will roll 4 dice. Let’s say the 4 dice are: 1 x Infantry, 2 x Armor, 1 x Star. The 2 armor dice do not help us (since we are recovering an infantry unit) but the Infantry die and the Star die allow us to bring 2 soldiers back in the unit which boosts our unit to 3 figures (Stars are like jokers in this case). Since we were able to recover at least 1 figure, we can now normall y order this unit (e.g. move out of the danger zone and then maybe attack an enemy unit). If in this case the dice roll is for example 4 Armor units, we cannot recover any figure and the turn ends here (no more orders). If we roll 2 flags and 2 grenades, it is the same outcome (turn ends). If we get 4 stars, we will only be able to recover 3 figures up to the unit’s maximum number which is 4. The remaining star will be ignored.Page | 15 14. THEIR FINEST HOUR This special card allows the player to order a random nu mber of his units, depending on his luck. When playing the card, he first takes a number of dice equal to the number of cards he has in hand in the current scenario , and rolls them. These dice will only specify how many units and of what type the player is able to order this turn. As in the “Medics and Mechanics” card, we can roll infantry (and then order infantry units), armor (and then order armor units) or star (and roll any unit we want , infantry, armor or artillery ). Flags and grenades are ignored. Example play: As soon as we play this card, we roll 5 dice (supposing our current scenario specified we should have 5 cards in hand). Some examples: - 2 x Infantry, 2 x Armor, 1 x Star: we will be able to order 2 Infantry units, 2 Armor units and one unit of o ur choice (including artillery). - 3 x flags, 2 x Stars: we will be able to order 2 units of any kind - 3 x infantry, 1 x Armor, 1 Grenade: in this case let’s say we have no infantry unit on the map, so we will only be able to order an armor unit, if available. As you see, an artillery unit can be ordered only if stars are rolled (there is no “artillery” sign on the dice). After we choose the units based on the outcome of the dice, they are ordered as per the normal rules, with a bonus: +1 die for each attack, added after applying normal battle and terrain reductions. A rule that is often ignored: after this card is played, all face down and discarded cards are reshuffled (maybe to give the other player also the chance to get this card).Page | 16 15. AIR POWER This is a powerful card when enemy’s units are grouped (adjacent to each other ). When playing this card, the player chooses a group of maximum 4 enemy units that are adjacent to each o ther and orders an “air” attack on them. Just like the “Barrage” card, t here actually is no unit on the board that attacks the enemy, it is considered to be a “bonus” attack from other off -board units (a virtual “air support”). Once the 4 grouped units are specified, the player attacks them one by one (w ith 2 dice if he is Al lied, with 1 die if he is Axis). Terrain reductions or battle reductions are all IGNORED. The attacked unit gets one hit on normal symbols rolled (infantry, armor or grenade which means any unit) but ALSO if stars are rolled. Flags cannot be ignored so the attacked units must retreat (or lose figures if it is unable to do so ). Example play: we are playing as Allies and we notice that in a far corner the enemy has 3 units placed in a straight line, adjacent to eachother. It does not matter how they are placed as long as they are adjacent. Examples: or (our example) We choose where to start (from left to right for example) and begin a surprise air attack on these units: we first roll 2 dice (we are Allies, remember; Axis only roll 1 die) for the leftmost infantry unit, then 2 dice for the middle one then 2 dice for the rightmost one. The order is chosen by the attac ker. Our sample rolls: - For the leftmost infantry unit: 1 x Flag, 1 x Armor. Unit loses 1 figure (armor is ignored, flag cannot be ignored even if there are terrain protections on that hex; the unit has nowhere to run from its edge hex). - For the middle infantry unit: 1 x Grenade, 1 x Star. Unit loses 2 figures. - For the artillery unit: 1 x Grenade, 1 x Star. The attack is powerful, the unit is down to 0 figures and we get a medal!Page | 17 GAME BASICS: A MEMOIR ’44 SAMPLE SESSION The last part of this document aims to give newcomers a good idea of how a Memoir ’44 session looks like. I will not discuss each and every move, but I will point out some of the important moments of a fight, some basics of ordering troops or interpreting die reductions as well as try to intro duce some of the tactic cards we already talked about. During the explanations we will not generally discuss good strategy , it’s up to the player to play, learn and discover this. Many of the moves will seem pointless, they will be chosen because I think t hey are important to show you HOW they should be played so, again, do not rely on correctness of gameplay strategy- wise. Reading and understanding the rulebook is vital and cannot be replaced with this document. Screenshots were made using the Vassal engin e - http://www.vassalengine.org/ . I will base our explanations on the Toulon scenario (Campaign for Southern France) – August 20 -26 1944 (http://www.daysofwonder.com/memoir44/en/editor/view/?id=23 ). Axis player gets 4 cards, Allied player 6 cards. The battle ends when the first player get s his 6th medal. Also, we have a “sudden death” condition: if at any time Allied units occupy 3 town hexes in Toulon at the end of their turn, they win immediately.Page | 18 1. UNITS IN THIS SCENAR IO Normal Infatry uni t. 4 soldier figures. Normal Armor unit. 3 tank figures. Only Allied player in this scenario . Elite infantry unit (may move 2 hexes and still battle, unlike normal units where the player has to choose between moving 1 hex and battle or move 2 hex and not battle). Only Allied player has this in this scenario . An “American Elite Infantry” badge is placed in each of the el ite units to differentiate them. Artillery unit. 2 artillery figures. Only Axis player in this scenario . 2. TERRAIN (IMAGES FROM THE NEW “AIR PACK” TERRAIN C ARDS)Page | 19 3. GENERAL VIEW The Axis side is well fortified with sandbags protecting them, units place d on hils or in towns, making attacks against Axis difficult or risky . Moreover, on the right side, forests will slow down Allied troops. The Axis artillery unit is protected by the town hex and the barbed wire that will decrease the efficiency of Allied infa ntry attacks (armor attacks might be a solution here , trying to go around the barbed wire or using tanks to remove the barbed wire). In the center section, 2 well protected Axis i nfantry units make it hard to move forward this way. 4. GENERAL NOTES Note 1: some sandbags are placed on hill hexes, some on town hexes. Still, t he reductions are never cummulative. Example: we attack an infantry unit in a town with sandbags, with an armor unit outside of the town. Towns provide a defense against armor units of -2 dice. Sandbags only provide -1 protection. These numbers are not added, but the highest one is used. In t his case, we will roll - 2 when attacking with the tanks. There’s a question here: why do we need the sandbags since even without them we would still be protected by the town hex with - 2 against armor? The answer is that although sandbags do not influence t he number of rolled dice, their protection against flags is retained (“ occupant may ignore 1 flag”). Towns do not normally offer protection to flags (retreats) but a sandbag on a town will allow the attacked unit to choose if it ignores or executes the fir st flag (if more flags are rolled, the other flags have to be carried out, only one can be ignored). <- new battle dice reduction symbols original symbols - > Note 2: the vast majority of terrains only specify how they PROTECT the units placed on them against other “external” infantry or armor attacks (artillery not included since it always ignores terrain protection). The unit on the hex never matters in these calcula tions: for example, in a FOREST it does not matter if we have an infantry unit, an armor unit or an artillery unit; the forest will protect a ny unit with -1 against infantry attack or - 2 against armor attack. Still, there are some terrain types which also specify reductions when ATTACKING from those hexes. For example, it is supposed that a tank does not have good maneuvrability or attacking power in a town so, as specified in the “Towns and Vi llages” terrain card, if attacking with an armor unit FROM a tow n hex, you have to roll - 2 dice. Only a small part of the terrain types limit the firepower of the units placed there (notably armor in towns battles out at -2 dice and infantry on barbed wire battles out at - 1 die) and there is no special symbol for this, just text on the terrain cards . Note 3: t he wording of the terrain cards or the rules is very important. If you “may” do something it means you are NOT FORCED to do it, but you may choose to do it. If you “must” do something it means you are FORCED to do that. For example, when protected by sandbags you MAY choose to ignore first flag rolled against you so you ARE NOT FORCED to retreat (you may or may not retreat). When entering a forest, a unit MUST stop, so there is no way that you can move further if y ou enter a forest hex (unless you’re retreating, in which case you are ignoring terrain hexes, but that’s another story). Note 4: w henever a Recon card is played (which allows the player to order only 1 unit in one section) at the end of the turn the player gets to draw 2 cards, choose one to keep in hand and discard the other. This advantage balances the low attack power of the Recon cards.Page | 20 5. BATTLE SESSION MOVE 1 – ALLIED PLAYER Allied pla yer plays a Probe card (2 units on the left to be ordered). We choose to move an infantry unit closer to the artillery unit. Since this is an Elite unit it can move 2 hexes and battle (a normal unit would only be able to move 1 hex and battle or move 2 hexes losing the right to battle). We also bring in some tanks , just to have artillery in range. If we bring them too close, the artillery will also have a better chance of hitting them. In this position, the artillery will only use 2 dice. If we get close r with the tanks, artillery will be able to roll 3 dice agains t the tanks (remember that artillery uses 3,3, 2,2,1,1 dice and we are now 3 hexes away, so 2 dice). Also, if we bring the tanks closer, near the Axis infantry, they will not be able to attack the artillery, because they are adjacent to another enemy unit: “a unit adjacent to an enemy unit must Close Assault t his unit if it chooses to battle; i t may not fire on another, more distant, enemy unit instead”. After we show the other player the units we will be ordering (infantry and armor) we get to the moving ph ase, so we move the 4 soldiers + badge and the 3 tanks as show n below. We can never split /combine units and we can never attack until we finished moving all units (i.e. we normally never move a unit once the battle phase started, unless we play a special c ard like “Behind enemy lines” or we “ Take Ground ” or make an “Armor Overrun”). Once units are moved, we attack our main target there: the artillery unit. In the battle phase that follows, we choose who is attacking what and in what order , one unit at a ti me (you ARE NOT forced to specify all the attacks in detail at the beginning of this phase; sometimes this rule helps you a lot, because you may want to attack one unit with more units of yours, but after the first attack, you roll some flags and the enemy retreats outside the attacking range of the other units; in this case, you can always attack other units in range ). Let’s say we start with the Infantry unit. We should first check that we have line of sight (we do, barbed wire does not block LoS) and the n calculate the number of dice to be rolled. We are 2 hexes away from the artillery, which means 2 dice (infantry attacks 3, 2 , 1 depending on the distance). Unfortunately, artillery is protected by the town (-1 die for infantry attacks) and the sandbags ( -1 die for infantry attacks). As pointed out before, the battle reductions are not cumulative, so we will get a total reductio n of - 1, as well as protection for 1 flag rolled, thanks to this special feature of the sandbags. Total number of dice: 2 – 1 = 1 die. We roll a FLAG. That’s not too good, because the enemy can now choose to ignore this flag (it is not forced to, he may as well retreat outside of town). The enemy does not retreat, since this means it would lose town protection, and our attack was not succesful. Same phases occur with tanks too. They have line of sight so we can go on calculating the number of dice. Tanks normally roll 3 dice, up to 3 hexes away (3, 3, 3 ). Towns have an even better protection agains tanks ( -2 dice) which is higher than sandbags protection ( -1) so -2 will be used . We roll 3 – 2 = 1 die : a GRENADE. At last we’re getting somewhere. An artillery unit is removed from the board and our turn ends. We draw a new card.Page | 21 MOVE 2 - AXIS PLAYER Axis Player play s now the “Direct from HQ” card which lets him order ANY 4 units he want s (any 0 -4 units actually, with 0 meaning “pass”). Axis show s the other player the units he will be ordering (an infantry in the forest and the artillery on the left side (since Axis is on the opposite side, we talk about their right side, but we will always refer to our left and right as we watch the map). Axis wil l also move 2 infantry units on the right side of the map. 4 units total. The next phase is the movement phase (I prefer to combine naming the ordered units with movement because it does not really influence anything, and I only get through the units once not twice). Axis will move the infantry out of the forest (which is not such a great idea, but we do it now to block the armor’s Line of Sight to the artillery as well as increase firepower for the infantry, now in Close Assault). The artillery is not mov ed so it is skipped. Axis also moves the 2 infantry units on the right. The one near the town of Toulon is moved 2 hexes so it cannot attack any more (there is no enemy unit in range anyway) and the other one moves to a hill, only 1 hex, so that it is stil l able to attack the Allied units. Once all movements take place, the Axis player starts attacking, in the order of his choosing. He starts with the artillery on the left. This unit can attack many possible units (it has a big attack range) but it wants t o focus on the tanks. Artillery units do not care about terraing reductions or line of sight, they just fire :). In this case, tanks are 3 hexes away which means 2 dice. The dice are rolled and we get INFANTRY and GRENADE. Infantry is ignored since we are attacking tanks, but the grenade does the trick and we have one less tank figure (unit goes down to 2 figures). Artillery ends its turn.Page | 22 The board after the movement phase: Axis goes now to the infantry unit, which is in Close Assault, without any terrai n reduction and of course with good Line of Sight which gets us a 3 dice roll. Axis gets ARMOR, STAR, GRENADE. Yupee ! STAR is ignored (it has no power unless used with special tactic cards), ARMOR eliminates a tank figure and GRENADE does the same. The tank unit is removed from the battlefield. One of the eliminated tank figures goes to a medal placeholder on the Axis side, which means they have now only 5 medals to go. Back to our last infantry unit: since the attack was a Close Assault and the attacked unit was eliminated (or forced to retreat) the unit can Take Ground now and move to the hex previously occupied by the tanks. Its turn is over (we should mention here that the tank units can also Take Ground, but they can also attack AGAIN after taking ground, which is called Armor Overrun – more details in the rulebook page 11). No unit is forced to take ground if it does not want to. On the right side of the board, one of the infantry units moved 2 hexes so no battle this turn (nobody to attack anyway) but the other unit, now placed at a safe height, chooses to attack one infantry unit below (second row from the bottom, second unit from the right). It rolls 2 dice (no terrain reductions, and the range is 2 hexes): FLAG and INFANTRY. Infantry means one fig ure is removed, but what about the flag? The flag means that the attacked unit MUST retreat (if not protected by something like a sandbag or a bunker). Unfortunately for this unit, it has nowhere to retreat, since both options to go back are occupied by ow n colleagues. In this case, a unit loses a number of figures equal to the number of flags that cannot be played – retreat is blocked – in our case 1 figure. The turn ends for the Axis player, he draws a new card.Page | 23 The board after the battle phase, at t he end of the turn : MOVE 3 – ALLIED PLAYER As the Allied player, since we liked the card that Axis played last turn, we will play “Couter -attack” which gives us the possibility to “copy” our opponent’s last card. So actually, by playing this card, we will play “Direct from HQ”. We will order the 4 red-dotted units on the screenshot below. O n the left, we moved an infantry unit so that the tanks will be able to get out of the corner and another infatry unit on the barbed wire near the artillery. It wou ld be nice to be able to go over the barbed wire to a clear hex and get rid of the “ infantry attacks with - 1 from wire hex ” rule, but unfortunately there’s another wire hex rule: “ unit moving in must stop”. On the right we moved an Elite unit over the hill near the enemy; the hill does not block or otherwise affect the movement unlike other hexes like towns, forests or even worse, hedgerows .Page | 24 This is the board after the movement phase: Next phase: battle. We will try to eliminate the infantry unit on the left with the help of our infantry unit and armor unit. We will NOT attack the artillery with the infantry nearby (we will spend that infantry unit’s turn to remove the barbed wire hence we cannot battle this turn; removal of the barbed wire will gain us a die at the next turn attack). On the right, the Elite unit is able to attack the unit on the hill, even if it moved 2 hexes. Infantry unit on bottom -left will go first. 3 dice, Close Assault. As soon as we tell the opponent that we are going to attack his infantry unit with ours, we get a surprise Ambush. The Axis player has in hand an “Ambush” tactic card and is now able to play it against our attacking infantry unit (it can be played only against a close assault, and before the attacker rolled the attacking dice). The Ambush card permits the Axis player to be the first to attack so he rolls 3 dice against our infantry unit: STAR, GRENADE, GRENADE. We are down to 2 figures, but we were not elliminated or forced to retreat with flags, so we can now attack back with 3 dice: INFANTRY, FLAG, GRENADE. The unit retreats one hex and loses 2 figures. It’s good we did not get 2 flags, otherwise Axis would have been able to move their unit into t he forest, which protects against armor attacks with - 2 dice. Axis draws a card by the way, since it played the Ambush card. The current board is show n below. Tanks follow, attacking the infantry unit again. Good thing Axis has no more Ambush cards and we can roll our 3 dice: GRENADE, GRENADE, GRENADE, a hard to get and destructive combination. Enemy infantry unit is no more, and since the armor made a Close Assault it can begin Armor Overrun.Page | 25 First it Takes Ground (moves on the hex previously occupied by enemy infantry) and is able to attack again, if there is any enemy in range. Of course we choose to attack Artillery again, even if only with 1 die (3 dice normal tank attack – 2 dice town prot ection). The armor unit is lucky again: GRENADE puts an end to the artillery unit which becomes a medal for the Allied side. Only 5 more to go. Since there are no more units in the town, the Sandbags are removed (they always are as soon as a unit leaves a hex either because it moves, it retreats or is eliminated). The remaining infantry unit on the left near the town has nobody to attack this turn (we didn’t expect such a powerful attack). Artillery is gone away, and we also cannot attack the infantry unit with the sandbags (2 normal attack at this distance – 1 for sandbags -1 because we are fighting from a wire hex = 0 so we cannot carry any attack). We will just remove the wire. On the right, we still have an attack to carry out. Our Elites use 2 dice (no rmal 3 for a Close Assault - 1 for enemy on Hill hex ): STAR, ARMOR. Enemy unit is untouched, but overall we got quite a nice attack this turn. Allied player draws a new card.Page | 26 MOVE 4 – AXIS PLAYER Axis gets lucky and plays “Air Power”. He can choose a maximum of 4 Allied units which are group ed (adjacent) and attack them one by one. The only downside: when playing this card, Axis only rolls 1 die per unit, Allied would roll 2 dice per unit. Axis chooses 4 units from the group in the bottom -right corner : elite infantry, the 2 normal infantry unit and the leftmost armor unit. One by one, these units will be attacked with 1 die. Axis rolls INFANTRY for the elite unit. Elite unit down to 3 figures. Axis rolls FLAG for the left normal infantry unit. Unit ret reats (it would retreat even if protected by sandbags or bunkers, since the card tells us “Flags may not be ignored” ). Good thing it has an available hex to retreat. Axis rolls FLAG again for the right normal infantry unit. Nowhere to retreat, the unit go es down to 3 figures Axis rolls STAR for the left armor unit, which is a miss. No change. The turn ends, Axis draws another card, the board is now:Page | 27 MOVE 5 – ALLIED PLAYER Allied plays now “Their Finest Hour”. This special card, as outlined in the first part of this document, allows us to order units depending on some dice. First, since thi s scenario gives Allies 6 cards , we ’ll roll 6 dice. We get: - FLAG – ignored - STAR – order 1 unit of our choice (we choose armor) - GRENADE – ignored - INFANTRY – order 1 infantry unit - INFANTRY – order 1 infantry unit - ARMOR – order 1 armor unit Of course, if we have no available infantry or armor units, we ignore the respective symbols. With this dice we get a total of 2 INF, 2 ARMOR. With this information in hand we sta rt choosing the units that will be ordered (can be chosen from anywhere on the board). These will be ordered, they will move/battle according to normal rules + 1 additional die for every attack . After the turn is over, the face down cards and discard deck is reshuffled together. Allied player draws a new card. [….] The game goes on as explained until one player gets 6 medals. As soon as a player gets its 6 th medal, the game ends immediately. In this scenario it also ends immediately if the Allied player ma nages to move 3 of his units to 3 of the 4 Toulon town hexes (sudden death winning condition). There are no objectives in this scenario so medals are won only by eliminating enemy units (one medal per enemy unit). In other scenarios, like Pegasus Bridge, t here are objectives/medals on the map. They may be Permanent objectives (once a unit manages to get on an objective hex it wins the medal placed on that hex and it can leave the hex without losing the medal) or Temporary objectives (in order to win such a medal, a unit must move on the objective hex and REMAIN there; if it is eliminated, retreats or moves away, the medal is returned from the player to the hex and must be won again). IN THE END I hope this document will help any Memoir ’44 beginner have a better experience playing this game, as well as get a better understanding of various rules and cards . As stated in the introduction, the rulebook remains the primary source of information and the FAQs are very important once a player gets into later scenarios and starts meeting different weird situations tha t need explaining. For any corrections or improvements please contact me on BGG. The stage is set, the battle lines are drawn, and you are in command. The rest is history.\n","\n","\n","\n","----------escenarios------\n","Pacific Theatre Scenario compilation Battles of Khalkhin-Gol ........................................

The British, Canadian and Indian forces of Major-General Christopher Michael Maltby, supplemented bythe Hong Kong Volunteer Defence Forces, did their best to resist the Japanese invasion, despite being vastly outnumbered and facingthe much more battle-weathered troops of General Takashi's 38th Division. By December 13, the last of the Commonwealth forces on the mainland, the Indian Rajputs, had retreated to Hong Kong Island, where Major-General Maltby organized the defense. On the 18th, the Japanese crossed the Strait, landing on the northeast of the island andsoon captured the Sai Wan Battery. Fierce fighting continued, but within 2 days, the island's defense forces were hopelessly divided. They nonetheless held until Christmas day, when, running out of water and ammunition, British Colonial officials led by the Governor of Hong Kong, surrendered. This was thefirst time in history that a British Crown Colony was surrendering to an invading force. The garrison had held out for 17 long days.

In the military build-up to the war, the US Navy began buildingan aero-naval base. By August of 1941, a small garrison composed of elements of the 1st Marine Defense Battalion wasin place, although armed inadequately with old 5\" cannons and 3\" AA guns. On December 8, 1941, a day after Pearl Harbor, a flight of medium Japanese bombers took off from the Marshall islands, rapidly bombing the bulk of the Marine Corps VMF-211 fighter squadron located on Wake into the ground.Three days later, the garrison repulsed a first Japanese landing attempt by the South Seas Force. On December 23, asecond Japanese attack wave, augmented with 1,500 Japanese Marines from the Special Naval Landing Forces, landedin the predawn darkness. Following the late night and morning of ferocious fighting the garrison was forced tosurrender. For their heroic defense, the men who defended Wake Island during those fateful two weeks would receive the Wake Island Device, a campaign clasp to the Marine Corps and Navy Expeditionary Medals.

ByAugust of 1941, a small garrison composed of elements of the 1st Marine Defense Battalion was in place, although armed inadequatelywith old 5\" cannons and 3\" AA guns. On December 8, 1941, one day after Pearl Harbor, a flight of medium Japanese bombers took off from the Marshall Islands, rapidly bombing the bulk of the Marine Corps VMF-211 fighter squadron located on Wake into the ground. Three days later, the garrisonrepulsed a first Japanese landing attempt by the South Seas Force. On December 23, a second Japanese attack wave, augmented with1,500 Japanese Marines from the Special Naval Landing Forces, landed in the predawn darkness. Following the late night and morning offerocious fighting the garrison was forced to surrender. For their heroic defense, the men who defended Wake Island during those fateful two weeks would receive the Wake Island Device, a campaign clasp to the Marine Corps and Navy Expeditionary Medals.

Armored amphibious tanks came ashore ahead of the infantry waves of the 1st, 5th and 7thMarines. But the bombardment had failed to destroy Colonel Kunio Nakagawa's soldiers and artillery resistance on theisland. Soon, their enfilading artillery and anti-boat gun fire inflicted severe vehicle losses on the LVTs. On the far left, the 1st Marines, led by Guadalcanal veteran, Captain George P. Hunt, flushed out the Japanese troops holed up in the caves of the 'Point'. In the center the 5th Marines met scattered resistance and moved inland towardthe airfield. Their advance, however, was soon halted because of the lack of progress on their left. On the far right, the7th Marines drew heavy fire from nearby islands, before veering off to their left and causing confusion on the centerlanding beaches. Around 16.30, a Japanese counter-attack of tanks and infantry across the airfield was repulsed and a second attack later in the day also thrown back.

After a month of hard fighting, their attack, plagued by poor supply lines, began to falter. Seeing an opportunity to counter-attack, General \"Punch\" Cowan ordered his 48th Brigade, made up mostly ofGurkha units, to interdict the Tiddim road near Torbung. The Japanese ordered units from both Moirang and Torbung to break through the blockingforces. As the fight escalated, both sides called in reinforcements but the Gurkha managed to hold out against every Japanese effort.

Scenario #10927 PT32Defense of Meiktila - Burma Campaign Setup order 1 x2 2 x6 3 x3 4 x1 5 x11 6 x8 7 x2 Meiktila Historical Background By early March of 1945, the 17th Indian Division in Burma, under the command of British Major-General David Tennent \"Punch\" Cowan captured the city of Meiktila, taking just 4 days to defeat the nearly 4000 Japanese who held it. The Japanese 18th and 49th Divisions, who originally had been sent to reinforce the city, were now asked to retake it. The arriving Japanese, having been involved in heavy fighting in the preceding weeks, were weakened and only able to muster about 12,000 men. The early attacks from the Japanese from the north and west were unsuccessful and they turned their attention to the airfield east of the town. Cowan's defenders, who numbered 15,000 before the battle, were being reinforced with both men and munitions as the Indian 9thInfantry Brigade continued their airlift support, even through heavy enemy fire. Japanese progress towards the airfield continued topressure the incoming flights, finally forcing Cowan to halt air landings and resort to parachute supply drops. However, the Allied air superiority, coupled with poor communications between the two Japanese divisions made it difficult for them to coordinate their attacks. Cowan kept up a vigorous and aggressive defense, sending out tank sweeps to force the Japanese to retire fromthe airfield and stall the siege.

Scenario #3730 PT35LAST PAGE\n","\n","\n","\n","----------tacticas------\n","If I may offer my $.02 on the subject. These are the lessons I’ve learned in my first six games of Mem ’44 (note: haven’t played with artillery yet). There's a bit of luck, no question, with this card-driven order system, but there is also a good deal of strategy. - Let’s get this obvious one out of the way: bisectional units do it both ways. Given the choice, a unit on a split hex has options. OK, we all know this. - Wait for it... Take advantage of Airpower. Wait for your opponent to line up 4 units adjacent to each other and then thin them out with airpower. Unless you simply MUST play a Flank card, take advantage of the situation and use the Airpower card on no less than 3 units. - Buy yourself time: If most of your units are in one section, move your other units away from potential harm to a “safe” place and let them hide while you wait for the cards you need. - On that note, use the “Recon” card that allows you to draw 2 Command cards and choose the one you want. Even though you can only command 1 unit, the CC benefit is worth it - Plan offenses two turns ahead. Make sure you have at least two of the cards you need to operate an offensive. You may be tempted to jump at an opportunity in front of you, but if you don’t have a Tactics or section card that you need to continue on the turn after, you probably should hold off. In fact, it may be a trap. - Traps, traps, and more traps! I’m a big fan of setting and springing traps: o The surprise offensive: I like to have one section card (e.g., 3 on the Left) and one Tactics card (e.g., Infantry Assault) ready to go. Before I play the trap, I get my poker face on, sigh, and play a card on another flank where I only have a few forces. Might do this two turns in a row to really set him up. My opponent thinks I must not have the cards I need, then the next turn I spring Infantry Assault (or some other special card) which surprises him and puts me on the offensive, hopefully inflicting some decent casualties. Next turn, I follow up with 3 (or better yet ALL) on the intended Flank. Or the reverse, whatever, but the Flank and Tactics card combo is a powerful 1-2 punch. If I’m lucky, I drew another card on those two turns that enables me to continue the offensive in some way. o The Firefight -- another trap: position your units at a distance from enemy units. Forego the opportunity to close assault them and use the Firefight card to blast your opponent. He may think you have a couple units who can hit him at 2 dice each when in reality it's 3 dice each b/c of the Firefight card. o The sucker punch/wounded duckling: this goes with the Firefight above – take a unit and charge him at your opponent or leave him in the open. If you can afford it, make it a wounded unit (too hard to resist). Let your opponent attack and then respond with Firefight and the additional die (or some other such Tactics card you have at the ready). I’ve seen my opponent reduce my unit to 1 figure and retreat it only to be torn to pieces by the firefight that he didn’t realize he walked into. - Target the weakling and take nothing for granted: Better to go after one unit with too much force than to spread it out. I prefer to go after a 3-figure unit with 8 dice rather than 6 and use the other 2 for another attack. I’ve seen too many times how Flags actually help a player move an almost eliminated unit out of harm’s way OR see him replenish the unit with “Medics & Mechanics” (the turn after I killed 3 of them! Urgh). - Keep your tanks at a distance. Since tanks fire into terrain at -2, they’re best served pouncing on units in the open. Use infantry to protect tanks (I know, counter-intuitive) and hold your tanks back until the opportunity for maximum damage presents itself. There are only 3 tanks in a unit; use them judiciously. - Vary your strategy. Poise your units in one flank for an offensive and your others for defense but actually spring your offensive from the \"defensive\" position. There's much to be said for keeping an opponent off-balance and not sure of what to expect. - Talk up your traps after you’ve sprung them the first time. When an opponent has a trap sprung on him, he learns to expect it so the next time he sees you laying off, he may think you’re setting a trap when in reality you just don’t have sh*t in your hand. And once you spring the trap the first time, it won’t be as effective, so you may as well use it for the mind-game. - Remember that you’re playing a card game as much as a board game. Keep your poker face on. Don’t put your right flank cards on the right of your tray, etc. Don’t give your opponent an idea as to how many or what type of each card you have. A friend of mine sighs, moans, and bitches about his cards all the time and then “reluctantly” plays a move 3 units card in the section where I least want it. Bastard had me thinking I was safe there. - Finally, always pull a \"Direct from HQ\" card when you need it.Nice article! A couple of things I have to remind myself of from time to time: Running away can be a good tactic, to protect that one or two figure group. Conversely, if there is a \"suicide mission\" like a long odds close assault that has to be performed, that one figure group that might get picked off by anyway is as strong as a full strength group on the attack.Well, I guess you've definitely turned around on your view of luck in Memoir! Nice article. A few thoughts of my own, mostly for the newer players: - Choose the order of your attacks carefully! Sometimes attacking in the wrong order can really screw you up. For example, you may roll a flag or two, allowing an enemy unit to escape follow up fire from another unit. Attack with the farther units FIRST! Also, save the units that have multiple possible targets for the end of your attack so they don't lose their attack if the primary target is eliminated/retreats. - Understand each unit's role. Infantry is to flush units out of defensive positions. Tanks are for fighting at range or encircling your opponent's units so they can't retreat. Artillery is for when you have a spare order or when there's an easy kill in range. - Never forget to use the terrain! A tank in a forest or firing across a river at infantry is potent, thanks to it's range. - If you get the chance to attack a unit that can't retreat, take it. Especially if it's artillery. Having flags count as hits is huge. - Getting medals for holding positions is great, but don't do it too early. Your opponent will probably just kick you out. Save it for the end when the medal(s) will actually win you the game. Forcing your opponent to defend those areas also reduces his flexibility, giving you a bit of an advantage. - Roll grenades whenever possible.Well, I guess you've definitely turned around on your view of luck in Memoir!

Yeah, I'm glad I gave the game another chance.- Wait for it... Take advantage of Airpower. Wait for your opponent to line up 4 units adjacent to each other and then thin them out with airpower. Unless you simply MUST play a Flank card, take advantage of the situation and use the Airpower card on no less than 3 units.Actually I find the first turn of the game a good turn to use this card on many scenarios. This is particularly true if you're the Allied player and you get to roll 2 dice. The beginning of the game often sees the most concentration of units adjacent to each other. Also, you can attack a back line and take advantage of them not being able to retreat. If you can get in an attack on a pesky artillery unit so much the better. I can see the advantages of waiting it out as well, but often I like to soften up my opponent before they even get started if I have this card at the first turn.- Wait for it...

I've played M'44 an awful lot since its release, mostly against the same gentleman. Both of us are gray bearded grognard wargamers from the last century. And I consider both us to be very good M'44 players. We played the Saint Vith scenario 3 times today. (It's supposed to be one of the more balanced ones.) All three times I played the Americans and all three times I won very close games, 6-5, 6-4 and 6-5. Richard probably is the better player of the two of us but not by much.- Keep your tanks at a distance.Richard and I were talking about this again tonight. Of course, throwing tanks into close assault versus Infantry in Woods or Villages isn't usually the wisest course. That said, both of us play our armor much more aggressively than anyone else we've played against. All other things being equal, we usually beat the \"lay back and soften them up from a distance\" type player. Keep in mind, Richard and I play two games, Memoir '44 and Command & Colors: Ancients almost to the total exclusion of everything else. Most of the other people we play against are not as experienced in the nuances of M'44 as we are. I am guessing that one fuzzy gauge of the degree of player aggressiveness in M'44 could be this... How many cards are played in an average game of M' 44? I was talking to one fella who said in games between himself and his wife they play 12 to 15 cards each before a game is decided. Between Richard and I, I'd say 7 to 10 cards each. That would be a very interest stat for me to learn. Let's put it this way... HOW MANY TURNS DOES AN AVERAGE GAME OF MEMOIR '44 LAST?- Keep your tanks at a distance.HOW MANY TURNS DOES AN AVERAGE GAME OF MEMOIR '44 LAST?On the Tank issue - I prefer to sum up each situation I find myself in. Keep them back if at great risk sure, but if I have a better than average opportunity to kill a unit and utilise Armour Assault, I'm prepared to suffer the loss of 1 unit to kill 2! The average number of turns for a game of Memoir is difficult to answer. The number of medals required, strength of card draws and nature of the opponent (defensive or offensive) will all combine to influence game length. The base game scenarios range between 4-6 medals on most occasions. I'd say that my games take between 5-10 turns (card draws) on average (probably closer to 10 than 5). I've played over 200 games so the sample size is pretty good.Well, I played the Allies twice tonight in scenario #3, Sword Beach and I got beat both times. The first time, I was way too impatient and started an offensive in each section without having anything to back it up. My luck the last game led me to be overconfident in pulling the card I needed. The second time could've gone either way (a 1 hit out of 5 on the last turn when I needed 2 cost me the game), but in general I brought my tanks up to attack my opponent and paid for it each time. I think I should've held them back a bit and moved my infantry in first. I'm getting the sense that the Allies (who usually outnumber the Germans) want to play a slower game and wait for their numbers to make a difference with more units in position before mounting an offensive.Let's put it this way... HOW MANY TURNS DOES AN AVERAGE GAME OF MEMOIR '44 LAST?I don't have any official stats, but since I have quite a few games logged on Vassal PBEM, I can see that most of my games take about 15 turns (so about 8 card draws per player) give or take. Eastern Front really seems to be a grinder though and a few of those games have taken upwards of 30-40 turns (15-20 card draws). Pacific usually goes much faster with the IJA getting the extra die in most cases and the USMC getting the extra order. Though Beda Fomm still takes the cake for being my fastest victory ever. Even though TFH almost always shows up and causes a reshuffle, I can safely say I have never made it through the entire deck in a single game yet. So I have never seen a game go higher than 50 turns, let alone 60. And that's a sample of 150 games.Ok, it seems our games are not exceptionally short compared to other players. The shortest game we've played was 6 cards, three per player. I may have done a session report. The longest game was one of our favorite scenarios, the Red Barricades scenario. It plays to 10 Medals. One of our games lasted 44 cards, 22 each. Their Finest Hour was never drawn so there was no reshuffle. In fact, I suspect Richard and I are only exceptionally aggressive in comparison to the really inexperienced players, newbs or players who aren't as obsessed with Borg designs and play other games.

ThanksScrib, I'm curious to hear you elaborate on the aggressiveness with which you play. Do you guys shout at each other? Just kidding! Whe you say you play aggressively, does that mean you move tanks in front of infantry? Does that mean you'll start an offensive without having a second card to continue it and hope you pull one? What do you mean? Would love to know more. And if I may offer an example... As I said, I played Sword Beach the other night as the Allies. Lots of infantry in the water to bring onto the beach. Before I did that, however, I moved some units up within striking distance of my opponent. He played an aggressive German strategy and started picking my front-line units apart while I still was trying to get the ones in back out of the water. It didn't hurt that he got Barrage and Air Power and was able to take out some of my tanks before they even got into play. In retrospect, my strategy was fractured. I was trying to engage units early and often and still muster the units in the back. Next time I would take my time and get my units on the beach and then attack en masse. How do you play that scenario?- Roll grenades whenever possible.Well unless you use the modified rule (grenades only count in close combat).I've been playing C&C: Ancients almost exclusively for a year*, so I don't remember if I've ever played the Sword Beach scenario. But when I say we play aggressively, I mean aggressively and smart. Neither of us advance in a section where we don't have cards in hand for sustain the attack unless there is the opportunity to pick up the game winning Medal that card play. I've taught several folks to play and they typically always shoot with their tanks from two or three hexes away in situations where Richard or I would move adjacent in Close Assault hoping to kill or retreat one target to get three more dice in an Armor Overrun. It is a standing joke between us that Richards Infantry does not hide behind sandbags, they use them as starting blocks to rush forward. None of this is to say we just push everything forward and roll dice but until a novice has a few games under their belt they often play overly cautiously. In November 2008 Richard and I set out to play all the official CCA Scenarios in chronological order twice, switching sides. So most other game play went by the wayside. We have 5 games to go.Ok, it seems our games are not exceptionally short compared to other players. The shortest game we've played was 6 cards, three per player. I may have done a session report.

ThanksIf I may slightly derail the topic here, this boggles my mind. I'm one of those super newbs, only five plays under my belt (the first five scenarios, most of those I played solo). How is it possible to win in 3 cards? I feel like most of mine have been in the 15-20 card range per player (although maybe that's just how it feels- it's been at least 10 for sure). Are some scenarios built for a quick game? I feel like after 3 cards I'm only just getting close to the first medal... And as an aside, I'm 95% certain that I'm playing the rules correctly- I've seen several playthrough videos and read the rules a few times. Thanks!If it's anything like my group it would be desert battles with tanks and getting Armour Assault early that lead to a quick win.The author of the Tactics and Strategy guide once won Arracourt as the Germans 6-0 in two turns, with Assault-R followed by Armor Assault.\n","\n","\n","\n","----------reseña_1_foro------\n","This review is the first detailed review I have attempted. I have tried to make this, part review and part resource, for anyone not totally familiar with the game. For this reason I expect readers to skip to the sections that are of most interest. Image Courtesy of Erich Summary Game Type - Board Game Play Time : 20-60 minutes Number of Players: 2-8 (Most commonly 2 players) Mechanics - Card Driven, Scenario Based, Dice Rolling Combat Difficulty - Moderate (Takes 6-12 plays to become totally familiar) Components - Very Good This is the first game I have revisited to do a more in depth analysis, as my first review was minimal to say the least. With over 200 plays of Memoir and the recent announcement of the Air Pack and further expansions, I felt the time was right to revisit the base game. Overview Memoir '44 is the 2nd game to be released in the 'Commands & Colours' System and like other games in the series Memoir is a scenario based board game. As the title suggests, the theme and setting for Memoir is WWII, and more specifically the D-Day landings and battles that took place in 1944. The majority of the scenarios feature the Germans and Americans although other countries are introduced through the use of Special Forces units. The game uses a double sided, six fold board to represent the battlefield and tile overlays are used to represent terrain. Miniatures are used to represent the forces (units) present in each battle. But more on the components later. Units are ordered through the use of Command Cards and these represent the orders issued by HQ to the troops on the front. Icon dice are then used to determine the results of each attack. Each scenario has a listed victory condition in terms of the number of medals that must be captured by each side. Medals can be won by eliminating enemy units or capturing scenario objectives. The base game offers a total of 16 Scenarios. Given that Memoir plays best by playing both sides (see below) and this takes time, Memoir offers pretty good value in terms of the time it will spend on the table. The game features two sides representing the Axis and the Allies, so 2 Player games are most common. However it is possible to play using teams and this can be a great way to teach new players as a team can assess their cards together and discuss possible orders and plans. Time to get out of the HQ tent and down into the Bunker. The System Memoir uses Command Cards to drive the play and these represent the orders issued to your troops. So in effect each player is acting as a General in charge of the troops. Each scenario outlines how many cards each side will receive and these are not always equal. This helps to reflect the nature of each battle. Elements such as surprise, planning, or a lack of reconnaissance can be reflected in the number of Command Cards a side receives. This thematic element isn't made highly obvious by the game itself, but it is the conclusion I have come to with experience. It makes the theme of the game more 'real' for me and this increases my enjoyment. Once a scenario is set-up, the play is actually pretty straight forward. The play is turn based and the side to go first is outlined in the scenario. Each turn begins by playing a Command Card from your hand of available cards. Each Command Card allows a set of orders to be issued and these usually result in moving troops and firing on the enemy. Dice are rolled to resolve each attack, casualties are eliminated and medals are possibly won. The number of dice to be rolled is determined by the unit firing, the range and any modifiers for terrain effects or special battlefield conditions (cover, troop type, etc). At the end of a player's turn they will check to see if they have won the medals required for victory. If not the scenario continues and the turn is completed by drawing a replacement Command Card from the deck. Now it's time for the enemy to return fire. The Battlefield - The Board in more Detail Memoir offers a double sided, 6-fold board. One side depicts a grassy field, representing the fields of Western Europe, whilst the other side depicts a beach head, comprised of sea, beach and grass area. The board therefore allows the game to depict battles in two separate settings - inland and beach landings. The board is entirely made up of hexes and only 1 unit is allowed per hex. There are 2 red dotted lines, which serve to break the battlefield up into 3 different sections (left, right and centre). This allows the Command Cards to refer to one or more sections of the battlefield, for the purposes of issuing orders. This is all very simple but also very effective. The final feature of the board is the 6 illustrations of medals at the foot of each Side's board. These are used to track how many medals a side has won. Images Courtesy of EndersGame The Units Memoir '44 offers a total of 3 basic troop types - Infantry, Armour and Artillery. Each troop type is represented by a generic figure made from soft plastic and these are functional. They won't impress the heavy war gamer or WWII historical expert out there but they are more than satisfying for the average gamer like me. Had Memoir gone down the alternate path of tokens and chits I don't think either you or I would be in this space right now. The forces in Memoir are always formed into units. Infantry units feature 4 figures, Armour units feature 3 figures and Artillery units are made up of 2 figures (special units may differ). Units can never be mixed or moved through one another and weakened units can never band together. Weakened units still roll the same number of battle dice as a fresh unit too. These movement and combat rules are not totally satisfying as they don't represent the reality of war (more on that later) but I understand why it was done. In my opinion, Memoir was designed to reach the mass market, light to medium gamer. I think it was aimed at filling the space between Euro's and War Games (feel free to line me up with your Sniper Rifle if you wish). Complicating the rules on how units interact would have potentially alienated that target audience. So the rules on the units are a result of function over form. Each hit on a unit results in 1 figure being removed. When the last figure of a unit is eliminated, the unit is destroyed and the last figure acts as a medal that has been won, adding towards your victory condition. Let's look at the units in detail - Infantry Movement - Infantry can move 1 hex and fire or they can move 2 hexes and not fire. Range and Combat - Infantry can shoot up to 3 hexes away and get 3, 2, or 1 dice in battle based on the range. The number of dice rolled can then be affected by terrain, special orders or special conditions. Taking Ground - If an infantry unit attack a target in an adjacent hex and the target are eliminated or forced to retreat, the attacking unit can 'Take Ground' by moving into the enemies' vacated hex. Image Courtesy of ricmadeira Armour (Tanks) Movement - Armour can move up to 3 hexes per turn before firing. Range and Combat - Armour have a range of 3 hexes but they allows roll 3 dice in combat before applying any modifiers. Armour Overrun - If an Armour unit attacks a target in an adjacent hex and the target are eliminated or forced to retreat, the attacking unit can 'Armour Overrun'. This allows the Armour unit to move into the vacated hex and attack again if an enemy unit is within range. This can be a devastating play and many a scenario has been won and lost by using multiple Armour Overruns. It is crucial to know how to use them and avoid them. Image Courtesy of Toynan Artillery Movement - Artillery are not highly mobile. They can only move 1 hex per turn and if they do they cannot fire for that turn. Range and Combat - Artillery can fire as far as 6 hexes away. They get 3 battle dice for a range of 1-2, 2 battle dice for a range of 3-4 and 1 battle dice for a range of 5-6 hexes. Most importantly, Artillery never suffer modifiers for terrain or cover. This makes them deadly if well positioned. Image Courtesy of Solamar Special Forces are introduced with the use of tokens that are placed in a hex along with the unit. The special forces featured in the base game include - British Commandos - These units are allowed to move 2 hexes and still battle. Rangers - These can also move up to 2 hexes and still battle. Axis Special Forces Tanks - Each unit has 4 figures instead of 3. French Resistance - Only have 3 figures per unit but they can enter terrain hexes and still battle. When forced to retreat they can elect to move back up to 3 hexes as opposed to the usual 1 hex. These units can seem like wraiths at times and can be very hard to earn medals from. Panzer Grenadiers - Can move up to 2 hexes and still battle. British Airborne - Can move up to 2 hexes and still battle. It becomes apparent from the list of units that there is much repetition of abilities and this is also replicated below in the effects of various terrain types. I have many thoughts here but I'll hold them back for my conclusions at the end. Image Courtesy of EndersGame The Terrain Tiles Of course a plain battlefield is rather dull, so Memoir uses terrain tile overlays. There are 44 Terrain Tiles in total and they are all double sided. Each tile is hex shaped so they can fit perfectly onto any hex on the game board. The tiles are of a good thickness, meaning they will stand up to hundreds of plays. The artwork is good but not great (the Battle Lore tiles make Memoir's look a little plain by comparison). Each scenario outlines how many terrain tiles of each type are needed and where they need to go. Some scenarios are heavy on the terrain, so a set-up order for the terrain tiles is included. This outlines the order in which you should place the tiles to ensure you don't run out of any one terrain. In all the base game offers the following terrain - Forests Movement - Units that enter a Forest hex cannot battle on that turn and they must stop immediately. Line of Sight - Forests always block line of sight. Battle - Infantry suffer a -1 dice penalty for firing into Forest hexes whilst Armour suffer a -2 dice penalty. Hills Movement - A hill imposes no movement restrictions unless stated in the scenario notes. Line of Sight - Hills block line of sight for units on ground level. Any unit on a hill will not be able to see a unit on the ground if the hill is 2 or more hexes in length and the unit is located at the base of those hills. This rule is not outlined in the rules and can be found on many forums including the Geek. Battle - Any Infantry or Armour unit firing at a target on a hill (higher ground) will suffer a -1 dice penalty. If an attacking unit is on a hill and fires at another unit on a hill, it will suffer no penalty. Hedgerows Movement - Hedgerows were typical in Normandy and are the most complex terrain in the base game. To move into a Hedgerow, a unit must have started the turn adjacent to the hex they wish to move into. A unit moving into a Hedgerow will stop immediately and they cannot fire this turn. A unit moving out of a Hedgerow can only move to an adjacent hex before stopping. Line of Sight - All Hedgerows block line of sight. Battle -Infantry suffer a -1 dice penalty for firing into a Hedgerow and Armour units suffer a -2 penalty. Towns & Villages Movement - All units moving into a town or village must stop immediately and cannot battle for that turn. Line of Sight - All towns and villages block line of sight. Battle - Infantry suffer a -1 battle dice penalty for firing into a town or village, whilst Armour units suffer a -2 penalty. In addition any Armour unit firing out of a town or village will also suffer a -2 battle dice penalty. Image Courtesy of EndersGame Rivers & Waterways No units can cross rivers or waterways unless a bridge crosses them or there are special rules outlined in the scenario summary. Line of sight and battle restrictions do not apply to this terrain. Oceans Units in ocean hexes are considered to be on landing craft of one kind or another. The maximum movement in ocean is 1 hex. Units can never battle whilst in ocean hexes and units cannot retreat into ocean hexes. Line of sight is never blocked by ocean. Beach A unit that moves onto a beach hex can only move a maximum of 2 hexes. If a unit starts on a beach hex but makes its first move onto a non-beach hex, it does not suffer the 2 hex maximum limit (I'm thinking Armour units here). Beach terrain has no effect on line of sight or battle. Image Courtesy of EndersGame Special Features In addition to the terrain, Memoir includes all of the special features we would expect from the theme in the form of smaller tiles, tokens or mini figures. Bunkers - Bunkers block line of sight but units can move into them and still battle. They are impassable to Armour and artillery and they only protect the original owner's units (the side that started with them at the beginning of the scenario) unless otherwise stated in the scenario notes. Infantry suffer a -1 battle dice penalty for attacking units in a bunker and Armour suffer a -2 penalty. Image Courtesy of EndersGame Sandbags - Sandbags allow the occupying unit to ignore the 1st flag rolled against it on each battle dice roll. Infantry attacking a unit in a sandbagged hex suffer a -1 penalty and Armour suffer a -2 penalty. If a sandbag installation is ever left vacant it is removed from the field of play. Barbed Wire - Units moving into barbed wire must stop but they can still battle. Armour will destroy the barbed wire removing it from the board, but infantry will battle out at a -1 penalty. An infantry unit can choose to remove barbed wire instead of battling. Therefore a unit that moves 2 spaces to reach a hex with barbed wire cannot remove it as they don't have the option to fire. Hedgehogs - Infantry may move in and through hedgehogs with no movement or battle restriction. Infantry in a hex with hedgehogs may also ignore the 1st flag rolled against them in each attack. Armour and Artillery units cannot enter a hex with hedgehogs. Image Courtesy of EndersGame Combat and the Battle Dice I have touched on combat in terms of the dice rolled by units at various points in this review already but I'll go through the process in its entirety here. Before I begin it is very important to note that all units must move before any firing can begin. As soon as any one unit makes an attack roll, no other units may fire. All units then fire independent of each other. By that I mean if one hex is targeted by multiple units, they do no roll their attack as one. Each attack is rolled separately and resolved before the next attack begins. A set firing order does not need to be made by a player. Each attack can be made and resolved before the next begins. In this way a clever player can attack with their units in such a way as to allow for potential foul-ups and cover multiple bases at the same time. LOS - When a unit wishes to attack they must first identify if they have Line of Sight (LOS) to the target. Terrain may block line of sight and units can also block line of sight to other units. Generally it is accepted that line of sight should be traced from the middle of the attacking hex to the middle of the target hex. If any part of that line can be traced through an LOS blocking hex, the target is not valid. Often a LOS check will be drawn perfectly between 2 hexes. As long as one of those hexes is not blocking LOS, the target is valid. Number of Battle Dice - Next you must determine how many dice you can roll for the attack. This is determined by calculating the range of the attack and identifying how many dice your unit type can roll at that range (if any). From this total you may have to deduct a number of dice for terrain or other features that effect battle. This may sound complex in print, but Memoir provides a number of summary cards that outline all of these considerations very easily. After just a few games it becomes second nature very quickly. The Battle Dice - Now it is time to roll the dice for the attack. Each Battle Dice features the following icons - Infantry Icon - x2 Armour Icon - x1 Grenade - x1 Flag - x1 Star - x1 One hit or casualty is scored for every icon rolled that matches the unit type being attacked. In addition the grenade icon counts as a hit against anything. So immediately it becomes apparent that their is a 50% chance of hitting an infantry unit per dice. Chances of hitting a tank is 33% and hitting an artillery unit is 1 in 6 or roughly 17%. Whilst the odds may suggest always targeting the infantry, this can be folly as armour and artillery units pose such a threat. Thankfully they only have 3 and 2 figures per unit, so a little luck on the dice goes a long way. A star is a missed result, but this icon is sometimes used in other ways by special Command Cards. Image Courtesy of Yugblad Retreating - Rolling a flag results in the targeted unit fleeing 1 hex. If multiple flags are rolled in a single attack, then the unit will be forced to retreat multiple hexes. Sometimes a unit cannot retreat, due to terrain restrictions (like ocean or impassable hills) or other units may block a retreat. For every hex that a unit cannot retreat, a casualty is inflicted. Sometimes it is possible to maneuver in behind enemy units, cutting off their retreat. If flags are rolled against them it will result in further casualties, thereby increasing the chance to hit them. Retreats must always be made back towards the owning player's side of the board. This means that each unit has no more than 2 hexes that they can retreat into for each flag. From a reality perspective I have issues with this. What if the attack is coming from the rear? Why would my troops retreat in this direction instead of fleeing the other way? The obvious answer is that the troops will always want to retreat towards their supply lines and they are no doubt confused in the heat of battle. In the end I have come to accept this rule as part of the game. Simplicity has its place. Resolving Combat and the turn - Each hit results on a unit being removed from the unit under attack. If the last unit is removed from a unit, that unit has been eliminated. To signify this achievement, the last unit should be placed on medal icon on the edge of the board to signify that a medal has been captured. If capturing a medal means one side has meet the victory conditions for the scenario the battle is over. If this is not the case after the last attack for a turn, the player ends their turn by drawing a Command Card from the Command deck and play passes to the enemy. Firefights and Close Assaults These are two terms that directly relate to battle. A 'Firefight' is a term relating to any unit that is attack at a distance (there is also a special Tactic Card with this name - see below). The term 'Close Assault' refers to any unit that attacks another unit in an adjacent hex. If a unit ever finds itself in an adjacent hex or 'Close Assault' situation, it is required to attack that unit when it fires. It cannot choose to attack another unit that is not in an adjacent hex. This can be used to one's advantage by deliberately engaging in Close Assault with the enemy, in order to stop them from firing on another weaker unit that could earn them a medal. It also has ramifications for selecting a retreat path when flags are rolled. Know What You are Playing Memoir is a wonderful game in my opinion if you take it for what it is. Memoir '44 is not a 'War Game' in the truest sense of the term. Memoir is a Card Driven Game (CDG) and it is all about 'Hand Management'. The skill to Memoir is identifying the strength of the cards at your disposal and how they can best be played with the troops at your disposal and their relative position in relation to the enemy and surrounding terrain. Making a push in one section without adequate troop support or without enough orders (Command Cards) to see the attack through will likely leave your troops highly exposed and ripe for the slaughter. Blaming poor card draws is all too often the catch cry of someone who has not planned carefully enough or simply played the game without a full appreciation for mechanics of the game. So if Memoir is a CDG, we should look at the Command Deck. Command Deck The Command Deck is made up of 60 cards which fall into two categories. Section Cards There are a total of 40 section cards. Each section card outlines the section(s) it relates to and how many units may be ordered there. Here is a short break down - Recon - Allows 1 unit to receive an order one section (different Recon cards will refer to different sections). At the end of the turn, 2 Command Cards can be drawn instead of the usual 1 and the player can select which card they wish to keep. Probe - Allows 2 units to be ordered in any 1 section. Different Probe cards refer to different sections. Attack - Allows 3 units to be ordered in any 1 section. Different Attack cards refer to different sections. Assault - Allows all units to be ordered in any 1 section. Different Assault cards refer to different sections. Pincer Move - Allows 2 units to be ordered in both flank sections (left and right). Recon in Force - Allows 1 unit in each section to receive an order. General Advance - Allows 2 units in each section to receive an order. Image Courtesy of EndersGame It should be noted here that some hexes on the board are cut in two by the dotted red line that denotes each section. These units are considered to be in both sections and can benefit from Command Cards that refer to either section. Tactic Cards There are a total of 20 Tactic Cards and these feature a grey background to help set them apart. Each card offers a fairly powerful order (when used in the right situation) outlined by its text, and generally these cards are meant to represent detailed planning direct from the Generals at HQ. In summary these cards include - Move Out (2) - Issue orders to 4 units of Infantry, regardless of their position. Direct form HQ (2) - Issue orders to any 4 units, regardless of their position. Counter-Attack (2) - Issue the same order as the last Command Card played by your opponent. IF it was a section card, then reverse the section it relates to (in other words you must order units in the same section as those ordered by the enemy). Infantry Assault (2) - Issue orders to all infantry in 1 section. They may move up to 2 hexes and still battle or move 3 hexes and not battle. Movement and battle restrictions still apply in relation to terrain. If you do not have any Infantry units, this card allows any 1 unit to be ordered. Armour Assault (2) - Order up to 4 Armour units in any location. Each unit that attacks in 'Close Assault' may roll 1 extra dice than normal. Movement and battle restrictions still apply in relation to terrain. If you do not have any Armour units, this card allows any 1 unit to be ordered. Barrage (1) - Target any 1 enemy unit and roll 4 battle dice, ignoring terrain modifiers. Flags may not be ignored. This is perfect for targeting units behind sandbags or in bunkers. Artillery Bombard (1) - Issue an order to all Artillery units. Each unit may move up to 3 hexes or battle twice. If a player has no Artillery units, they can order any 1 unit of choice. Dig-In (1)- Allows up to 4 infantry units to receive a sandbag emplacement. If a player has no Infantry units, they can order any 1 unit of choice. Medics & Mechanics (1) - Issue an order to any 1 unit. Roll a number of battle dice equal to the number of Command Cards you currently hold (including this one). For each star or icon rolled that matches the unit type, 1 lost figure of that unit is replaced. A unit can never exceed its initial strength. As long as at least 1 unit is recovered, that unit can be ordered in the usual fashion. Close Assault (1) - All Infantry and Armour units that are adjacent to an enemy unit can attack and receive 1 additional battle dice. These units may not move but they can 'Take Ground' and perform an 'Armour Overrun' action. Firefight (1) - Allows any 4 units to fire at targets within range and receive one additional battle dice. These units may not move and they cannot be in 'Close Assault'. Ambush (1) - Can be played in the opponent's turn as soon as they declare a 'Close Assault' attack. It allows your targeted unit to attack first. If the Ambush results in the unit being eliminated or forced to retreat it cannot fight back. The player who played the Ambush card should draw a replacement card before the opponent draws a card to end their turn. Air Power (1) - Targets a group of 4 or fewer adjacent enemy units. If the Allied side uses this card, they can roll 2 dice per hex and score a hit for each dice that matches the unit type, a grenade or a star. Flags cannot be ignored. If the Axis side uses Air Power, they can roll 1 dice per hex. This reflects the weakened status of the Luftwaffe in 1944. Their Finest Hour (1) - Roll 1 battle dice for each card you currently hold (including this one). Each unit symbol rolled results in 1 unit of that type being ordered. Star results mean any unit of choice can be ordered. All ordered units can be in any location on the battlefield and they receive 1 additional dice in combat. This is potentially the most powerful card in the deck but I have lost count of how many times I have rolled poorly with 5 or 6 dice and only received 1 or 2 orders. Behind Enemy Lines (1) - I have left this card to last as it is the one card that was poorly printed and does not reflect the designer's intention. It allows any 1 Infantry unit to move up to 3 hexes, battle and move 3 additional hexes after the attack is concluded. The unit also receives 1 additional dice. The error is that the card states that terrain and battle restrictions still apply. This is not the case and makes the card very useful. Allowing an Infantry unit to move up to 3 hexes through forest or hedgerows and potentially roll 4 dice in combat is a great way to finish off a weakened unit that thought it was safe. This is a great way to earn that final medal. Image Courtesy of johncarlton The Scenarios Given that Memoir is a scenario based game, it was important that they got the scenarios right and thankfully they did. Each scenario is outlined in full colour and consists of 6 key sections. Name and Date - Outlines the name of the engagement featured by the scenario and the date it took place in 1944. Map - Features a map of the board and all of the terrain present. It also outlines the starting position for each side's units. just make sure you have the map and board in the same orientation when setting up. Set-up Order - A small sidebar that outlines how many tiles of each terrain are needed. The order of this set-up is also important as the terrain tiles are double sided. The combination of the map, this sidebar and a little experience can see a scenario set-up in as little as 5 minutes. Historical Background - I really dig this feature as each scenario features a small paragraph or two that outlines the situation. The right light, a little atmospheric music and the reading of the HB can all add to the gaming experience. Briefing - This section outlines how many Command Cards each side gets and who goes first. Conditions of Victory - This section outlines how many medals are needed for victory and all the special rules (and forces) relating to the scenario. Scenario Balance I have heard many a gamer get annoyed at some of the scenarios because they are not balanced. I have always struggled to understand this notion as there have been few battles in history that have pitted equal forces in equal conditions, with equal morale etc. But I recognise that these people are referring more to the chances of success with one side as compared to another. I think it is fairly commonly accepted that the best way to play Memoir is to have both players (or teams) play each side of a scenario. By recording the medal count and casualty count earned with each playing, a total scenario score can be calculated for each player (or team). This can then help decide who was the better player of the scenario. I personally never play Memoir without this method and I often enjoy playing the underdog more and seeing if I can reduce the margin of defeat. The main argument against using this system is time as a beginner can take up to an hour to play one side of a scenario. However with experience and having the rules fully under your belt, it is possible to play both sides of a scenario in 50-70 minutes. But for those seeking the most balanced of scenarios from the base game I give you - Scenario Analysis All stats featured here come from the Days of Wonder Battle Reports Webpages. Pegasus Bridge - With almost 1500 reports at the time of writing this the Allies had a healthy 68% win ratio. Not particularly balanced but I love trying to hold those damn Allies with the Germans sandbag nest. Saint-Mere-Eglise - With just over 850 reports at the time of writing the Allies had a healthy 63% win ratio. This is largely due to the air drop afforded the Allies and the poor unit position of the Germans. Still, get the air drop wrong and the Germans can still hurt you. Sword Beach - With just over 915 reports at the time of writing the Germans only hold a 52% win ratio. This should keep the balance freaks happy! Pointe-du-Hoc - With just over 500 reports at the time of writing the Allies had a healthy 69% win ratio. I love the nervous tension just before the Allied troops break in a wave over the cliffs. It's like watching the Liverpool midfield storm towards a hapless Derby penalty box! (See EPL results September 1st, 2007). Omaha Beach (First Assault Wave) - With almost 650 reports at the time of writing the Axis had an alarming win ratio of 80%. Balance junkies need not apply. Mont Mouchet - With just under 500 reports at the time of writing the Germans only hold a 51% win ratio making it spot on. I love playing those nimble French and watching the Axis Special Forces Armour units burn. Vassieux - With just over 300 reports at the time of writing the Axis had a healthy 61% win ratio. I love how the Allies start with a couple of exposed units from the off. Retreat little birdie, retreat! Operation Cobra - With almost 450 reports at the time of writing the Allies hold a 51% win ratio making it spot on for the Karma Police. Operation Luttich (Counterattack on Mortain) - With almost 450 reports at the time of writing the Axis hold a satisfying 55% win ratio. I love the rules regarding Hill 317. Toulon (Campaign for Southern France) - With just over 250 reports at the time of writing the Allies had a healthy 66% win ratio. I love pounding away with the German Artillery for as long as possible before falling foul of the Allied infestation. Liberation of Paris - With just over 250 reports at the time of writing the Allies had an alarming 78% win ratio. Gee who would have thunk it from the title. Montelimar (Campaign for Southern France) - With just over 300 reports at the time of writing the Allies hold a reasonable win ratio of 58%. Personally I have won twice as often with the Germans (4-2). It's all about the central hills and the town of Grane. Arnhem Bridge - With just over 275 reports at the time of writing the Allies had a demoralising win ratio of 83%. I must confess that even I have trouble liking this one but I've only given it 2 goes. Arracourt - With just over 260 reports at the time of writing the Allies had a healthy 65% win ratio. But I defy you not to enjoy this one with all those Armour and artillery units blazing away. St Vith, Ardennes - With just over 200 reports at the time of writing the Axis hold a narrow 51% win ratio. Can you feel the Yin and the Yang? Saverne Gap, Vosges - With just under 220 reports at the time of writing the Axis hold a narrow 53% win ratio. I suspect the low number of plays is mainly due to the fact that this is the last scenario in the book (not counting the Overlord scenario). That makes for 8 fairly balanced scenarios and a few others that are within the realms of acceptance. But beyond the stats, use the 'Play both sides' method and all is well. Did I Mention Scenarios (or Re-playability) Whilst this may not relate to the base game of Memoir in the truest sense, it does reflect on owning the base game. Memoir has a very strong community and there are now literally hundreds of fan designed scenarios on the web ready to download and use. This makes the game infinitely re-playable, even before looking at scenarios. The Final Word If you've made it this far and have read every word, I award you a Purple Heart, Victoria Cross or whatever other medal you desire. It's probably no surprise to hear me say I am a big fan of Memoir '44. I love the game and I always will, even when it is compared to other games in the series or elsewhere. But I've also tried to drop hints all the way through this review about its limitations. Time for the Pro's and Con's. Strengths It scratches that itch between Euro and War Game without the 3 hour-plus time frame of some larger combat based CDG's. This was a middle ground that was dying for a few titles to fill the void. The components are really very good, from the box to the rules, through to the player aids. The only thing holding me back from giving the components an excellent rating is the artillery units, which are a little flimsy. The System is excellent and whilst it has been tweaked by the likes of BattleLore, there are elements here that I think are still highly appealing. Namely... Set-up and Play Time - One of the things that puts me off BattleLore just a little (only a little) is the increased set-up and play time. Memoir for me has both of these issues nailed down beautifully. It is possible to play 3 scenarios, both ways, in 3 and a half hours. That feels satisfying. Simple - For me Memoir works thanks to its simple nature (this can also be a weakness - see below). You don't have to refer to a 50+ page rulebook to play Memoir as all of the details needed for each Scenario can be summarised on a few cards. Anything more complicated for me when I first discovered Memoir would have possibly been too much. Thanks to Memoir I am now ready to march into the likes of Tide of Iron and Twilight Struggle. Fun - The greatest test for any game. Even after 200 plays I pulled it out just last week and had a great time over 2 scenarios. Weaknesses Simplicity - Whilst I listed it as a strength above, it is also a weakness. It does irk me that so many terrains have the same effect on units. It seems to take away from the reality of the theme somewhat. Lack of Feel (reality) - After many plays the lack of reality does begin to niggle in the back of the mind. The way in which the units move and behave does not convey the real nature of WWII at all. It does feel like I am moving plastic bits around a board. This takes away from the experience and therefore makes it a weakness. Unit interaction (or lack thereof) - This leads off from the last point regarding reality. Whilst your chances of success are limited if units are not moved together in packs, it does not necessarily result in failure either. I can't begin to tell you how many times I have been successful with a single marauding Armour unit that manages to roll well and make use of an equally successful Armour Overrun. One Armour unit should not be allowed to decimate the opposition. But they can. No Continuity - Scenario play is all well and good but it would have been nice to have seen some scenarios linked together into a campaign, whereby one result would affect the outcomes and forces in future scenarios. I feel this has been a real opportunity lost and even after all this time since the release, there are still no official campaign rules of any depth (please don't raise those half hearted campaign rules that came with one of the expansions). Sigh... Where are you in your gaming journey? - Memoir is spot on for anyone who is looking for something a little different but isn't ready for a Tide of Iron or Twilight Imperium level of complexity. However for anyone else who is looking for more, Memoir in its base box form probably looks a little underdone. Having the victory condition determined purely by the number of units eliminated (in most cases) just doesn't feel right. It would have been nice to have some 'real' objectives to try and achieve other than 'kill as many of the enemy as possible'. I mean even First Person Shooter video games left that model behind at the turn of the century. In the end how much you love or hate Memoir will be a matter of personal preference, experience and opinion. I'm in the love category and I'm comfortable with that.

Por mi perfil de jugador y el de mis diversos grupos, son diseños que no nos encajan demasiado por duración y complejidad (no tanto a nivel mecánico como de asimilación del juego en sí para sacarle provecho y no actuar de forma cuasi-aleatoria). Aquí es donde entra Richard Borg, autor del juego que hoy nos ocupa y, más concretamente, de un sistema de juego que estrenase con Battle Cry (wargame sobre la Guerra Civil Americana) que, de forma ultrasimplificada, acerca esta clase de juegos a los que, como yo, nos parecen una inversión de tiempo excesiva para la satisfacción obtenida.Empezaré justificando lo que acabo de soltar en el párrafo para que contextualicéis el tocho que se avecina. Partimos de la base de que la mayoría de los wargames requieren un mínimo de unas tres horas para desarrollar una partida (y de ahí para arriba), sin incluir la explicación, que suele implicar una buena dosis de detalles puntillos que hay que refrescar durante la propia partida. Mi semana lúdica suele reducirse a una partida diaria de una hora y pico como máximo y alguna sesión durante el fin de semana, pero nada especialmente espectacular (4-5 horas como mucho). Así que, las posibilidades de encajar un juego de este tipo, ya solo por duración, son muy reducidas.Lo siguiente es la motivación. Ya sabéis que soy un eurogamer de pro y lo que a mí me motiva especialmente son más mecánicas, más allá del nivel de interacción y/o azar. Encuentro especialmente satisfactorio escudriñar nuevos diseños y ver cómo han engarzado los distintos elementos. Desde este punto de vista, los wargames no me atraen especialmente, no al menos explorar el género porque tengo el prejuicio de que todo me va a saber más o menos a lo mismo. Esto es porque creo (que me corrija algún grognard) que lo principal en un juego de estas características es la simulación y la recreación histórica. Si el interés por lo que ocurrió en la realidad no es lo suficientemente intenso, la experiencia no va a aportar gran cosa al jugador, como también ocurre con los juegos temáticos. Es necesaria esta predisposición para, supongo, disfrutar de estos diseños. Predisposición de la que habitualmente carezco. De hecho, en mi caso suele ocurrir al revés, y es gracias al juego cuando me intereso por acontecimientos históricos, como ya me ocurriese con Twilight Struggle (aquí su tochorreseña) o A Few Acres of Snow, por poner un par de ejemplos que, sin ser wargames (al menos de forma estricta), sí que tienen esta componente histórica.Supongo que el señor Borg pensó esto mismo y prefirió alejarse de estos wargames tan absorbentes y optar por un diseño mucho más directo y sencillo, con las simplificaciones justas para mantener un mínimo de simulación, pero sin perderse en mil condicionantes. A esto le unimos una casa como Days of Wonder que, si por algo se caracteriza es por ofrecer juegos asequibles (familiares en su mayoría) y lo aderezamos con el evento histórico que mayor tratamiento ha tenido desde que ocurriese, esto es, la Segunda Guerra Mundial, tenemos la receta del juego que hoy nos ocupa. He de confesar que son estos últimos dos aspectos los que me hicieron acercarme a Memoir ’44. Vamos a ver qué me encontré.¿Y qué nos encontramos cuando abrimos la caja? Pues un tablero a doble cara, unas cuantas losetas con elementos geográficos, unos pocos dados con símbolos en sus caras, algunos tokens un mazo de cartas con no demasiado texto y un montón de miniaturas que vienen a sustituir a los counters, destacando las de infantería y carros blindados. Y con esto el señor Borg nos ofrece un diseño que no solo funciona a las mil maravillas, sino que es capaz de recrear hasta 16 batallas históricas acontecidas en la mayor contienda bélica de la historia (hasta el momento). Y, como ya he dejado caer, de una forma tremendamente sencilla.Memoir ’44 se encuentra dentro de los wargames tácticos, siendo su mecanismo principal es el famoso Motor de Cartas, una submecánica de la gestión de mano mediante la cual los jugadores asignan órdenes a las distintas unidades disponibles en función de las cartas que actualmente poseen, limitando el margen de maniobra y evitando los colapsos mentales cuando no hay barreras a la hora de actuar. El turno de un jugador es tan simple como escoger una de las cartas que posee, aplicar sus efectos y dejar paso a su rival.Es cierto que estas cartas y los diversos condicionantes podrían complicarse hasta el infinito, pero no es el caso. En el mazo encontramos dos tipos de cartas. Una, las de sección, que son las más fáciles de aplicar ya que no hay ni que leer texto, indican cuantas unidades pueden activarse en los distintos flancos. Las otras, las de táctica, sin aplican efectos algo más elaborados, pero que no dejan de ser ligeras modificaciones sobre lo que podría llevarse a cabo con las cartas de sección.El resto del turno se reduce a desplazar a activar las unidades correspondientes, desplazándolas y/o entrando en combate contra unidades enemigas. Y tanto lo uno como lo otro se resuelve de forma tremendamente ágil. Cada unidad (solo hay tres tipos) poseen unas determinadas características de desplazamiento (número de casillas sobre las que pueden desplazarse), puntos de vida (número de miniaturas) alcance (distancia a la que podrían atacar a un objetivo rival) y potencia de fuego (número de dados que se van a lanzar para resolver el combate). A estas características hay que añadirle las modificaciones del terreno que, si bien podrían parecer bastantes, se resumen en unas pocas cartas que nos ahorran el tener que estar consultando al manual si aún no nos hemos aprendido de memoria dichas características. Una vez ajustado, por cada unidad que ataque se lanzan los dados y se aplican las bajas: una miniatura retirada por cada símbolo que aplique sobre dicha unidad. Y así, turno a turno, se desarrolla la partida hasta que uno de los dos contendientes alcanza la condición de victoria, que en la mayoría de escenarios consiste en alcanzar una serie de puntos de victoria. Puntos que, por lo general, se obtendrán eliminando unidades rivales.Como veis, nada especialmente complejo y que se explica de forma ágil, sin necesidad de entrar a abordar toda la casuística posible. Basta con indicar los condicionantes que aplican sobre el escenario y a jugar, ya que raro es el despliegue en el que haya de todo. Así que, en este sentido, fuera miedos, ya que Memoir ’44 es un juego realmente asequible, sobre todo comparado con eurogames densos como podrían ser los del señor Lacerda: Vinhos (aquí su tochorreseña) o Kanban (aquí su tochorreseña). Es, sin duda, esta agilidad lo que nos enganchará de inicio, mientras que el resto nos irá enamorando poco a poco.Y es que, a medida que uno acumula partidas, se da cuenta de lo versátil del sistema y la capacidad de implementar esas batallas de forma relativamente fidedigna sin necesidad de alcanzar un nivel de simulación profundo que pueda abrumar al jugador ocasional. Es cierto que cada escenario tiene sus peculiaridades, pero se resumen en un pequeño párrafo y no suponen una alteración demasiado importante de las normas estándar.Pongamos algunos ejemplos. Los terrenos que permiten a la infantería resguardarse provocan que los blindados pierdan capacidad de fuego contra ellos (bosques, ciudades, etc.) pero, a su vez, dificultan el tránsito de la propia infantería al encontrarse en un terreno más dificultoso. O las alambradas, que frenan en seco a la infantería, teniendo que emplear dos turnos (uno en entrar y otro en salir), mientras que los blindados pueden arrasar con el metal espinado como si no existiese. O las defensas anticarro, que impiden el tránsito de los blindados, pero pueden servir como protección a las unidades de infantería, reduciendo las probabilidades de tener que retirarse ante una ráfaga enemiga. Todo esto está resumido en unas pocas cartas de referencia que memorizaremos en un par de partidas (basta con aplicar el concepto una o dos veces en un escenario y ya quedará grabado a fuego en nuestra mente).Al final, lo fundamental es saber leer el escenario y asumir el papel que corresponda. Normalmente hay un bando que, por situación, debe tomar la ofensiva, mientras que el otro debe culebrear y buscar las oportunidades de ir anotando puntos con paciencia, tirando de picardía. David contra Goliat. No tiene por qué ganar el más fuerte, pero ser el más fuerte suele ser una ventaja difícil de superar.Todo esto está muy bien, pero hay que lanzar una advertencia especialmente dirigida a los amantes del control. Memoir ’44 es un juego con un factor de azar elevado. Muy elevado. Ya puedes maniobrar de forma impecable, que, si la dama fortuna decide darte la espalda, vas a tener realmente complicado hacerte con la victoria. Para empezar, la aleatoriedad propia de un mazo de cartas. Recordemos que dichas cartas aplican sobre flancos concretos o bajo ciertas circunstancias. Pues bien, si la disposición en el tablero no concuerda con lo que tenemos en mano, puedes llegar incluso a bloquearte, viéndote obligado a «perder» un turno jugando una carta con la que no puedes activar ninguna unidad únicamente para robar una nueva carta.A esto le añadimos el azar típico de las tiradas de dados. Es cierto que las condiciones en las que dichas tiradas se efectúan sí que pueden estar bajo control (terreno, distancia, línea de visión, potencia, etc.). Pero siempre tendremos al típico colega con mano de eurogamer que no le sale un éxito ni harto de vino. Y sin causar estragos en las unidades enemigas, la victoria se pone un pelín cuestarriba. Así que ojo con esto, que más de uno puede acabar desesperado. Afortunadamente, una partida de Memoir ’44 rara vez supera la hora de duración, así que siempre nos quedará la opción de la revancha inmediata.Es por esto que muchos jugadores optan por jugar dos veces seguidas el mismo escenario, alternando bandos, de forma que cada uno puede demostrar su valía en ambas situaciones, tomando como resultado final bajas causadas en ambas partidas, como si de una eliminatoria a ida y vuelta se tratase.Con todo, Memoir ’44 es un magnifico juego que, además de servir como iniciación al mundo de los wargames, puede colmar la curiosidad de muchos jugadores, no necesitando profundizar mucho más allá. Por establecer un caso similar, Memoir ’44 sería el Stone Age (aquí su tochorreseña) de los juegos de colocación de trabajadores. Sirve perfectamente para saber si el diseño encaja con tus gustos, pero muchos no querrán ir más allá y les bastará con el juego de la edad de piedra.Como ya supondréis, la rejugabilidad es más que destacable al incluir el juego básico un total de 16 escenarios asimétricos, de forma que cada uno se puede jugar un mínimo de dos veces con cada bando. Treinta y dos partidas amortizarían sobradamente el juego. Además, cada escenario tiene un sabor propio, permitiéndonos profundizar en el acontecimiento histórico recurriendo a la Wikipedia tras la victoria o derrota para ver cómo se desarrolló en la realidad. Pero, por si no fuese suficiente, en la página oficial de la editorial podemos encontrar numerosos escenarios diseñados por los jugadores, además de los diversos packs de expansión que añaden, además de batallas, nuevas unidades, terrenos y normas. ¡Como para aburrirse!En el tema de la escalabilidad, si bien el juego permite formar equipos, yo solo lo concibo como un diseño a dos jugadores. Eso de dividir funciones entre varias cabezas pensantes es algo que no termina de encajarme (ni en este ni en otros juegos).Pasemos a la edición. Si por algo se caracteriza Days of Wonder es por ofrecernos unas ediciones cuidadas al milímetro. Y Memoir ’44 no es ninguna excepción. Los elementos de cartón tienen el suficiente grosor como para resistir el paso de las partidas, si bien es cierto que la lámina externa es demasiado porosa para mi gusto. Cuidado con derramar cualquier liquido sobre alguno de estos componentes, pues tiene pinta de absorber tanto como una bayeta. En las miniaturas hay luces y sombras, ya que, si bien las de infantería y blindados son densas y consistentes, las de artillería o las defensas anticarro deben ser tratadas con mimo si no queremos estropicios. Como curiosidad, destacar la exagerada escala de la miniatura que representa el alambre de espino, más grande que una miniatura de infantería. Las cartas son de una calidad excelsa, con un gramaje supremo, una resistencia elástica que permitiría usarlas como trampolín y una textura lisa muy agradable. Como siempre, recomiendo el enfundado, ya que las cartas se barajan bastante, aun incluyéndose unos prácticos sujeta-cartas que nos evitarán tener que estar manoseándolas. Los dados de madera están completamente pintados y tienen un peso aceptable. Por último, el reglamento es un ejemplo de claridad a la hora de explicar los diferentes conceptos. Con una lectura se hace uno rápidamente con la mecánica, sobre todo gracias a los numerosos ejemplos que complementan el texto.Aquí me gustaría detenerme en un par de aspectos que afean el conjunto global. En primer lugar, el tema de las losetas a doble cara. Es cierto que ahorran espacio, pero preparar ciertos escenarios exige un ejercicio de prueba y error hasta dar con la combinación correcta de losetas según su cara, dándose situaciones del tipo «no puedo completar el rio porque las losetas de bosque que había colocado contienen los tramos de agua que me faltan». El otro tema es el de marcar las unidades que se han desplazado. Durante el turno, el movimiento de las unidades activadas se completa antes de proceder a atacar. Si activamos bastantes unidades (3 o más) y en el tablero hay una gran densidad de las mismas, es fácil despistarse y no tener claro cuales se han movido y tienen opción a combatir. No habría estado mal la inclusión de algunos marcadores para indicar esto.En cuanto al arte, solo puedo tener buenas palabras. La portada tiene un tono adecuado al juego que contiene, utilizando un estilo cómic que, si bien podría restar importancia al tema tratado, ya nos pone en situación. Es un juego de guerra, pero un juego de guerra para todos los públicos. Los elementos del terreno son bastante atractivos para ser simplemente detalles del terreno. También son destacables las ilustraciones de las cartas, en especial las de tácticas, cada una con un dibujo distinto acorde al efecto y título de las mismas.Y vamos cerrando. Memoir ’44 es el juego perfecto de iniciación a los wargames tácticos, con un sistema tremendamente asequible, divertido y ágil que lo hace apto para todos los públicos sin mermar demasiado el componente de simulación histórica. Además, es tan versátil que permite representar numerosos escenarios sin necesidad de aplicar excesivas variantes a las reglas generales. Tal vez la mayor pega que se le puede encontrar es una influencia del azar que muchos pueden considerar excesiva, además de un flujo de turno al que tal vez le convendría una pequeña pensada para evitar confusiones. Por todo esto le doy un…\n","\n","\n","\n","----------reseña_3_you_tube------\n","[Music]I got introduced into board games afterhaving a history in tabletop miniatureWar Games whilst I love the

behind Memoir 44 are quitesimple upon reading the rule book thatis both well written and has greatexamples I was somewhat concerned themechanics were too simple and that thegame couldn't possibly offer strategicor tactical play at all the game Ithought must have a strong element ofluck and my assumption for this wasbased on the dice and card play involvedand whilst luck is certainly involved inthe mechanics in m44 I never felt nowgames that having luck on your sideplayed a part in actually winning a gameof M 44 I felt tactics did after myfirst play I was already seeing strategyin the game but I will say it's sort ofit's sort of a game where by the end ofyour opponent's next turn any strategyyou may have had going into the game umwell it may have already gone out thewindow by the end of his turn which isone of my my favorite things about thisgame believe it or not it seems toalways keep you on your toes and reallyfocus on every move your opponent makesand adjust your tactics as he

battles of some of the most famous historic battles of World War II including Omaha Beach, Pegasus Bridge, Operation Cobra and the Ardennes.\n","Memoir '44 includes over 15 different battle scenarios and features a double-sided hex game board for both beach landings and countryside combat. Each scenario mimics the historical terrain, troop placements and objectives of each army. Commanders deploy troops through Command and Tactic cards, applying the unique skills of his units -- infantry, paratrooper, tank, artillery, and even resistance fighters -- to their greatest strength.\n","\"By design, the game is not overly complex\", says Memoir '44 designer, Richard Borg. \"The game mechanics, although simple, still require strategic card play, timely dice rolling and an aggressive yet flexible battle plan to achieve victory.\" In addition to the large, double-sided gameboard, Memoir '44 includes 144 amazingly detailed army miniatures - including historically accurate infantry, tanks and artillery; 36 Obstacle pieces, 60 illustrated Command cards, 44 Special Terrain tiles, and 8 Custom Wooden dice.\n","Memoir '44 is designed for 2 players but easily accommodates team play. With Memoir '44 Overlord scenarios, players can use multiple boards and up to 8 players to conduct large scale operations, experiencing the challenges of troop coordination and military chain of command on a large scale battlefield. Average game length is between 30 and 60 minutes, encouraging match play where players can command first one side and then the other.\n","The Memoir '44 series consists of the base game and a number of expansions.\n","This game is based upon Richard Borg's Command and Colors system.\n","\"\"\"\n","get_triadas('¿Cuáles entidades y relaciones identificas en el texto?',texto)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":54},"id":"sjXeCvU8T5GP","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1739498785671,"user_tz":180,"elapsed":2582,"user":{"displayName":"Facundo López Crespo","userId":"17242818259053124562"}},"outputId":"e8f28a8e-264e-457d-e440-aa4139f79f72"},"execution_count":77,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["\"Entidades:\\n1.

If this is your first game of Memoir ’44, we strongly suggest you start with the first battle - Pegasus Bridge, p 19. This battle was both the openingengagement of D-Day and is a good introductory scenario to Memoir ’44. 2 - Place the board in the center',\n"," 'Place the board in the center of the table, with the proper face (countryside or beach landing) visible. For Pegasus Bridge, this means the countryside face up. 3 - Place the necessary Terrain hexes, as indicated by the battle scenario.

For Pegasus Bridge, this means two bridges, one over each river, and four barbed wires and asandbag placement to protect the bridge’s perimeter. 5 - Now place the figures on the board, matching the various units’ positions to the scenario’s battle map.Experience shows that dropping one figure per hex, for posi-tioning purposes, then filling up the units as',\n"," 'then filling up the units as required, is thequickest way to set up. An Artillery unit is usually made of 2 figures, an Armor unit - 3 and an Infantry unit - 4. 6 - Add the Special Unit badges to individual units and Victory Medals to specific, on-the-map objectives, ifrequired per the scenario’s special rules. For Pegasus Bridge, place an Allied victory medal on each bridge. 7 - Place the',\n"," 'on each bridge. 7 - Place the Terrain summary cards that correspond to the terrain in the scenario (Wood, Towns & Villages and Rivers summary cards for Pegasus Bridge) , plus the Obstacle and Units summary cards, to the board’s side, for in-game reference. If needed, refer to Terrain in Appendix 2 (p 13)for additional details on each terrain’s effects. 8 - Assemble the cardholder segments and',\n"," 'the cardholder segments and place them on the board map’s edges. The card holders are not necessary, but are particularly useful when playing in teamsof multiple players to a side, or in a classroom/demonstration environment. With them, players on a same side can point to and study various options. 9 - Now choose each player’s side and sit in front of the board accordingly. Given the relatively',\n"," 'Given the relatively short duration of a typical battle scenario, we recommend match play, with each player taking first one side, then the other in an immediate re-match.This helps balance any historical advantage that one side may have in a particular scenario.

Terrain movement and battle restrictions still',\n"," 'and battle restrictions still apply ( e.g. if entering a forest after a 1 hex move, a normal infantry unit must still stop and cannot battle – per the forest restrictions - even if this card would allow it to continue the move and/or attack ).

BEHIND ENEMY LINES First of a ll the card is wrong (I understand it has been revised and reprinted). The correct description: “[…] Terrain',\n"," 'description: “[…] Terrain movement and battle restrictions still apply […]” This card allows you to send a unit in the middle of the enemy’s territory (“behind enemy lines”), attack and then come back. The player chooses 1 infantry unit (no matter the section) and this unit will be allowed to: - Move up to 3 hexes (0 -3 hexes) ignoring terrain movement restrictions ( e.g. it can pass through 3',\n"," '( e.g. it can pass through 3 towns without stopping just as if there was no hex in its way )! - Attack an enemy unit (using 1 additional die as a bonus but applying any present battle reductions ) - Move again up to 3 hexes (0 -3 hexes) ignoring terrain movement restrictions. Some notes: - Any of the 3 actions above can be skipped (they are not mandatory; e.g. you can only attack without moving,',\n"," 'only attack without moving, or attack and then move, or just move 6 hexes (3+3 with no attack), etc .). - The unit cannot pass unpassable terrain (rivers are still blocking movement for all troops). - There is no requirement to move towards enemy territory; for example you can use this card to order an infantry unit with only 1 soldier figure to “return home” from enemy territory by ordering it',\n"," 'territory by ordering it to move 6 hexes towards your side (it can also attack somebody on i ts way back, after the first 3 hexes). - A unit cannot move 2 hex es, attack, and then move 4 hex es for a total of 6.

CLOSE ASSAULT This card is best played when many of the player’s units (infantry or armor, not artille ry) are adjacent to enemy units because this card lets you order ALL these units . There is no movement allowed before or after playing this card (Taking Ground and Armor Overrun are permitted). Ordered units get to roll 1 additional die (the',\n"," 'to roll 1 additional die (the rule applies only to initial attack of a unit, not also in the Armor Overrun phase).

The units that are not a djacent to enemy',\n"," 'are not a djacent to enemy units will be ignored this turn.Page | 12 11. DIG -IN This card has many issues already clarif ied in the FAQ so I will not repeat them here. Basically the card allows a player to choose 4 infantry units from all over the board and improve their pro tection by placing sandbags on the units’ hexes. The units are not allowed to move and/or attack during this turn, they',\n"," 'attack during this turn, they just work hard to protect themselves by building the sandbags. If the player has no infantry unit available, he may issue a normal orde r to 1 other unit of his choice (move/battle).Page | 13 12. FIREFIGHT When a player plays this card, he can choose 0 -4 of his units (no matter the type) and order them. These units: - Cannot be adjacent to ANY enemy unit - May not',\n"," 'to ANY enemy unit - May not move during this turn (they can only fire/battle if there are enemy units in range) Each of these 4 units will roll 1 additional die when attacking. Terrain and battle restrictions still apply (first the number of dice to be rolled is calculated, per the normal rules then 1 die is added to th e result ). Of course, if an enemy infantry is 4 hexes away from our infantry',\n"," 'hexes away from our infantry unit – out of range - we cannot attack it, thinking that “we normally have 0 dice to roll and we add 1 which means we will attack with 1 die”. The attacked enemy unit MUST be in r ange first of all.Page | 14 13. MEDICS AND MECHANICS This card gives the player a chance to recover some or all of the figures of an incomplete unit (a unit that suffered casualties). First',\n"," 'suffered casualties). First the player chooses one of his units to be recovered or repaired (any type is accepted). Then he rolls 1 die for each command card he has in hand including this card ( e.g. the current scenario specifies that the player has 6 cards, so he will roll 6 dice). The rest is explained pretty well on the card: for each unit symbol 1 lost figure of that unit is returned to',\n"," 'of that unit is returned to duty. Star also counts in this case as a “recovery point”. A unit MAY NOT gain more figures than it originally had ( e.g. infantry will only have a maximum of 2 figures, normal armor units 3 figures, etc ). The good part: if after rolling this dice the player recovers at least 1 figure for that unit, the unit can also be issued an order (like any normal order: move',\n"," '(like any normal order: move and/or attack). Grenades and flags are ignored. An artillery figure can be repaired (re covered) only by roll ing a star (there is no “artillery” sign on the dice). Example play : we have in the heart of the enemy territory a poor infantry unit that suffered many casualties, it is down to 1 soldier figure and is a sure medal for the enemy. We can choose to help thi s',\n"," 'We can choose to help thi s unit by playing this card. After playing it, we specify to the other player the unit we will recover (our infantry unit) and if the current scenario specifies we should have 4 cards in hand, we will roll 4 dice.

The 2 armor dice do not help us (since we are recovering an infantry unit) but the Infantry die',\n"," 'unit) but the Infantry die and the Star die allow us to bring 2 soldiers back in the unit which boosts our unit to 3 figures (Stars are like jokers in this case).

If in this case the dice roll is for example 4 Armor units, we cannot recover',\n"," 'units, we cannot recover any figure and the turn ends here (no more orders). If we roll 2 flags and 2 grenades, it is the same outcome (turn ends). If we get 4 stars, we will only be able to recover 3 figures up to the unit’s maximum number which is 4. The remaining star will be ignored.Page | 15 14. THEIR FINEST HOUR This special card allows the player to order a random nu mber of his units,',\n"," 'random nu mber of his units, depending on his luck. When playing the card, he first takes a number of dice equal to the number of cards he has in hand in the current scenario , and rolls them.

As in the “Medics and Mechanics” card, we can roll infantry (and then order infantry units), armor (and',\n"," 'infantry units), armor (and then order armor units) or star (and roll any unit we want , infantry, armor or artillery ). Flags and grenades are ignored. Example play: As soon as we play this card, we roll 5 dice (supposing our current scenario specified we should have 5 cards in hand).

As you see, an artillery unit can be ordered only if stars are rolled (there is no “artillery”',\n"," '(there is no “artillery” sign on the dice). After we choose the units based on the outcome of the dice, they are ordered as per the normal rules, with a bonus: +1 die for each attack, added after applying normal battle and terrain reductions.

AIR POWER This is a powerful card when enemy’s units are grouped (adjacent to each other ). When playing this card, the player chooses a group of maximum 4 enemy units that are adjacent to each o ther and orders an “air” attack on them. Just like the “Barrage” card, t here actually is no unit on the board that attacks the enemy, it is',\n"," 'that attacks the enemy, it is considered to be a “bonus” attack from other off -board units (a virtual “air support”).

GENERAL VIEW The Axis side is well fortified with sandbags protecting them, units place d on hils or in towns, making attacks against Axis difficult or risky . Moreover, on the right side, forests will slow down Allied troops. The Axis artillery unit is protected by the town hex and',\n"," 'protected by the town hex and the barbed wire that will decrease the efficiency of Allied infa ntry attacks (armor attacks might be a solution here , trying to go around the barbed wire or using tanks to remove the barbed wire).

GENERAL NOTES Note 1: some sandbags are placed on hill hexes, some',\n"," 'placed on hill hexes, some on town hexes. Still, t he reductions are never cummulative. Example: we attack an infantry unit in a town with sandbags, with an armor unit outside of the town. Towns provide a defense against armor units of -2 dice. Sandbags only provide -1 protection. These numbers are not added, but the highest one is used. In t his case, we will roll - 2 when attacking with the',\n"," '- 2 when attacking with the tanks. There’s a question here: why do we need the sandbags since even without them we would still be protected by the town hex with - 2 against armor? The answer is that although sandbags do not influence t he number of rolled dice, their protection against flags is retained (“ occupant may ignore 1 flag”). Towns do not normally offer protection to flags (retreats)',\n"," 'to flags (retreats) but a sandbag on a town will allow the attacked unit to choose if it ignores or executes the fir st flag (if more flags are rolled, the other flags have to be carried out, only one can be ignored). <- new battle dice reduction symbols original symbols - > Note 2: the vast majority of terrains only specify how they PROTECT the units placed on them against other “external”',\n"," 'them against other “external” infantry or armor attacks (artillery not included since it always ignores terrain protection). The unit on the hex never matters in these calcula tions: for example, in a FOREST it does not matter if we have an infantry unit, an armor unit or an artillery unit; the forest will protect a ny unit with -1 against infantry attack or - 2 against armor attack. Still, there',\n"," 'armor attack. Still, there are some terrain types which also specify reductions when ATTACKING from those hexes. For example, it is supposed that a tank does not have good maneuvrability or attacking power in a town so, as specified in the “Towns and Vi llages” terrain card, if attacking with an armor unit FROM a tow n hex, you have to roll - 2 dice. Only a small part of the terrain types limit',\n"," 'of the terrain types limit the firepower of the units placed there (notably armor in towns battles out at -2 dice and infantry on barbed wire battles out at - 1 die) and there is no special symbol for this, just text on the terrain cards . Note 3: t he wording of the terrain cards or the rules is very important. If you “may” do something it means you are NOT FORCED to do it, but you may choose to',\n"," 'do it, but you may choose to do it. If you “must” do something it means you are FORCED to do that. For example, when protected by sandbags you MAY choose to ignore first flag rolled against you so you ARE NOT FORCED to retreat (you may or may not retreat). When entering a forest, a unit MUST stop, so there is no way that you can move further if y ou enter a forest hex (unless you’re retreating,',\n"," '(unless you’re retreating, in which case you are ignoring terrain hexes, but that’s another story). Note 4: w henever a Recon card is played (which allows the player to order only 1 unit in one section) at the end of the turn the player gets to draw 2 cards, choose one to keep in hand and discard the other.

The majority of the scenarios\",\n"," 'The majority of the scenarios feature the Germans and Americans although other countries are introduced through the use of Special Forces units.

But more on the components later. Units are ordered',\n"," 'later. Units are ordered through the use of Command Cards and these represent the orders issued by HQ to the troops on the front.

Given that Memoir plays best by playing both sides (see below) and this takes time, Memoir offers pretty good value in terms of the time it will spend on the table.

However it is possible to play using teams and this can be a great',\n"," 'teams and this can be a great way to teach new players as a team can assess their cards together and discuss possible orders and plans.

It makes the theme of the game more 'real' for me and this increases my enjoyment. Once a scenario is set-up, the play is actually pretty straight forward.

Each Command Card allows a set of orders to be issued and these\",\n"," \"orders to be issued and these usually result in moving troops and firing on the enemy. Dice are rolled to resolve each attack, casualties are eliminated and medals are possibly won.

If not the scenario continues and the turn is completed by drawing a replacement Command Card from the deck. Now it's time for the enemy to return fire. The Battlefield - The Board in more Detail Memoir offers a double sided, 6-fold board. One side depicts a grassy field, representing the fields of Western\",\n"," 'the fields of Western Europe, whilst the other side depicts a beach head, comprised of sea, beach and grass area. The board therefore allows the game to depict battles in two separate settings - inland and beach landings. The board is entirely made up of hexes and only 1 unit is allowed per hex. There are 2 red dotted lines, which serve to break the battlefield up into 3 different sections (left,',\n"," \"3 different sections (left, right and centre). This allows the Command Cards to refer to one or more sections of the battlefield, for the purposes of issuing orders. This is all very simple but also very effective.

As soon as any one unit\",\n"," 'As soon as any one unit makes an attack roll, no other units may fire. All units then fire independent of each other.

In this way a clever player can attack with their units in such a way as to allow for potential foul-ups and cover multiple bases at the same time.

Generally it is',\n"," 'other units. Generally it is accepted that line of sight should be traced from the middle of the attacking hex to the middle of the target hex.

As long as one of those hexes is not blocking LOS, the target is valid. Number of Battle Dice - Next',\n"," 'Number of Battle Dice - Next you must determine how many dice you can roll for the attack. This is determined by calculating the range of the attack and identifying how many dice your unit type can roll at that range (if any). From this total you may have to deduct a number of dice for terrain or other features that effect battle. This may sound complex in print, but Memoir provides a number of',\n"," 'Memoir provides a number of summary cards that outline all of these considerations very easily.

If multiple flags are rolled in a',\n"," 'flags are rolled in a single attack, then the unit will be forced to retreat multiple hexes.

If we activate enough units (3 or more) and there is a high density of them on the board, it is easy to get confused and not be clear about which ones have moved and have the option to fight.
